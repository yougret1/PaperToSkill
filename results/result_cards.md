## AI Scientist-v2 Paper-To-Skill Scaffold

- Experiment: deterministic scaffold on `papers/notes/ai_scientist_v2_note.md`.
- Main result: generated `generated_skills/ai_scientist_v2/SKILL.md` with a
  source map and source-anchored workflow, validation, and failure cases.
- Compared baselines: no baseline run yet; this is the first retained real-paper
  scaffold case.
- Practical significance: demonstrates that PaperToSkill can ingest a real
  paper-derived note and preserve operational workflow elements without remote
  LLM availability.
- Deterministic rubric: `results/evaluations/ai_scientist_v2_rubric_v0.json`
  scored 20/20.
- Rubric interpretation: v0 confirms required sections, source anchors,
  workflow keyword coverage, failure keyword coverage, and compactness under
  1200 words. It does not measure downstream task success or human fidelity.
- Failure modes: depends on human-created paper note quality; source anchors are
  line-level references into extracted text, not PDF page-level citations yet.
- Limitations: not a full-paper automatic extractor; no LLM-assisted fidelity
  audit; no downstream task run yet.
- Claim impact: supports the claim that the local scaffold can produce a
  compact, source-anchored, structurally valid paper-derived skill from a
  curated real-paper note. It does not yet prove downstream task improvement
  over summaries.
- Figure/table: none.
