## AI Scientist-v2 Paper-To-Skill Scaffold

- Experiment: deterministic scaffold on `papers/notes/ai_scientist_v2_note.md`.
- Main result: generated `generated_skills/ai_scientist_v2/SKILL.md` with a
  source map and source-anchored workflow, validation, and failure cases.
- Compared baselines: no baseline run yet; this is the first retained real-paper
  scaffold case.
- Practical significance: demonstrates that PaperToSkill can ingest a real
  paper-derived note and preserve operational workflow elements without remote
  LLM availability.
- Deterministic rubric: `results/evaluations/ai_scientist_v2_rubric_v0.json`
  scored 20/20.
- Rubric interpretation: v0 confirms required sections, source anchors,
  workflow keyword coverage, failure keyword coverage, and compactness under
  1200 words. It does not measure downstream task success or human fidelity.
- Failure modes: depends on human-created paper note quality; source anchors are
  line-level references into extracted text, not PDF page-level citations yet.
- Limitations: not a full-paper automatic extractor; no LLM-assisted fidelity
  audit; no downstream task run yet.
- Claim impact: supports the claim that the local scaffold can produce a
  compact, source-anchored, structurally valid paper-derived skill from a
  curated real-paper note. It does not yet prove downstream task improvement
  over summaries.
- Figure/table: none.

## AI Scientist-v2 Context Baseline Coverage

- Experiment: deterministic context coverage evaluation for
  `benchmarks/tasks/ai_scientist_v2_research_run.json`.
- Main result: the PaperToSkill-generated skill scored 7.867/9, compared with
  1.733/9 for a generic summary and 1.2/9 for abstract-only context.
- Compared baselines: `baselines/ai_scientist_v2_generic_summary.md` and
  `baselines/ai_scientist_v2_abstract_only.md`.
- Practical significance: the generated skill preserves more task-relevant
  operational details for planning an AI Scientist-v2-like research run,
  including stage management, node lifecycle, debug/refine policy, limitations,
  and source grounding.
- Statistical evidence: none yet; this is one deterministic task and one paper.
- Failure modes: keyword-based scoring can over-credit shallow mentions and
  under-credit paraphrases; it does not evaluate actual agent behavior.
- Limitations: not a human or LLM execution study; not yet a multi-paper
  benchmark; generic summary quality is hand-authored and may not represent all
  summarizers.
- Claim impact: supports a narrow form of the compactness/fidelity claim: on one
  source-grounded task rubric, the generated skill preserves more operational
  capabilities than summaries while staying under the compactness budget.
- Figure/table: `results/evaluations/ai_scientist_v2_context_baselines_v0.json`.
