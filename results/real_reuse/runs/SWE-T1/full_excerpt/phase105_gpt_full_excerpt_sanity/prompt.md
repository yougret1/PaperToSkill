                                                    Language model (LM) agents are increasingly being used to automate complicated
                                                    tasks in digital environments. Just as humans benefit from powerful software
                                                    applications, such as integrated development environments, for complex tasks like
                                                    software engineering, we posit that LM agents represent a new category of end
                                                    users with their own needs and abilities, and would benefit from specially-built
                                                    interfaces to the software they use. We investigate how interface design affects the
                                                    performance of language model agents. As a result of this exploration, we introduce
                                                    SWE-agent: a system that facilitates LM agents to autonomously use computers to
                                                    solve software engineering tasks. SWE-agent’s custom agent-computer interface
                                                    (ACI) significantly enhances an agent’s ability to create and edit code files, navigate
                                                    entire repositories, and execute tests and other programs. We evaluate SWE-agent
                                                    on SWE-bench and HumanEvalFix, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both
                                                    with a pass@1 rate of 12.5% and 87.7%, respectively, far exceeding the previous
                                                    state-of-the-art achieved with non-interactive LMs. Finally, we provide insight on
                                                    how the design of the ACI can impact agents’ behavior and performance.


                                         1   Introduction
                                         Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of LM agents for code generation with execution feed-
                                         back [39]. However, applying agents to more complex code tasks like software engineering remains
                                         unexplored. To solve programming tasks, LM agents are typically designed to use existing applica-
                                         tions, such as the Linux shell or Python interpreter [53, 57, 59]. However, to perform more complex
                                         programming tasks such as software engineering [20], human engineers benefit from sophisticated ap-
                                         plications like VSCode with powerful tools and extensions. Inspired by human-computer interaction
                                         (HCI) studies on the efficacy of user interfaces for humans [7], we investigate whether LM agents
                                         could similarly benefit from better-designed interfaces for performing software engineering tasks.

Consider the simple setting of an agent interacting directly with a Linux shell [59]. In practice, we
find that LM agents can struggle to reliably take actions in this environment. For example, it fails to
provide simple commands to edit a small file segment, and does not provide any feedback if the user
makes an invalid edit. These deficits substantially hamper performance, motivating the need for an
agent-computer interface (ACI), i.e., an abstraction layer between the LM agent and computer, to
enhance the LM agent’s abilities in computer environments (Figure 1).
From this effort, we introduce SWE-agent, an agent composed of an LM and ACI, that can interact
with a computer to solve challenging real-world software engineering problems, such as those
proposed in SWE-bench [20]. In contrast to the Linux Shell’s granular, highly configurable action
space, SWE-agent’s ACI instead offers a small set of simple actions for viewing, searching through
and editing files. The ACI uses guardrails to prevent common mistakes, and an agent receives specific,
concise feedback about a command’s effects at every turn. We show that ACIs tailored specifically
for LMs outperform existing user interfaces (UIs) designed for human users, such as the Linux shell.
Using GPT-4 Turbo as a base LM, SWE-agent solves 12.47% of the 2,294 SWE-bench test tasks,
substantially outperforming the previous best resolve rate of 3.8% by a non-interactive, retrieval-
augmented system [20]. We perform an ablation study on a subset of 300 SWE-bench test instances
(SWE-bench Lite) to analyze our ACI design choices. The results show that SWE-agent solves 10.7
percentage points more instances than the baseline agent, which uses only the default Linux shell.
Although our ACI was developed for GPT-4 Turbo, we show that it is portable to a different LM;
SWE-agent with Claude 3 Opus can solve 10.5% of the benchmark tasks.
Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce the concept of the agent-computer interface (ACI)
and demonstrate how careful ACI design can substantially improve LM agent performance without
modifying the underlying LM’s weights. Second, we build, evaluate, and open-source SWE-agent, a
system that provides LMs an ACI for solving real-world software engineering tasks. Unlike prior
works that independently explore the merits of tool use, prompting techniques, and code execution
in interactive settings, our approach unifies these factors within the ACI framework. We show that
crafting LM-centric interactive components has meaningful effects on downstream task performance.

2   The Agent-Computer Interface
An LM acts as an agent when it interacts with an environment by iteratively taking actions and
receiving feedback [42, 62]. Typically, the environment has hard constraints, as in robotics, where
agents control actuators in the physical world. On the other hand, digital environments can be molded
by abstractions in the form of application programming interfaces and user interfaces for software and
humans respectively. Naturally, existing interfaces have been designed with one of these users in mind.
We argue that LM agents represent a new category of end user, with their own needs and abilities.
We refer to the interface LM agents use to interact with computers as the agent-computer interface
(ACI). Figure 2 illustrates how ACIs provide LM agents with important functionality to interface
with computers, similar to how code editors also help humans use computers more effectively.

Figure 2: Specialized applications like IDEs (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) make scientists and software
engineers more efficient and effective at computer tasks. Similarly, ACI design aims to create a
suitable interface that makes LM agents more effective at digital work such as software engineering.

Disparities in humans’ and LMs’ abilities and limitations motivates different interface design guide-
lines. For instance, the current generation of LMs lack the visual understanding abilities to directly
operate GUI-based applications with rich visual components and signals. However, many of the
features provided by these applications, such as syntax checking and navigation tools, could be useful
to LM agents if they were presented in a suitable manner. Additionally, humans can flexibly ignore
unnecessary information, whereas all content has a fixed cost in memory and computation for LMs


                                                  2
and distracting context can harm performance [27]. Therefore, LM agents may be more effective at
interacting with computers when provided an interface that was built informed by these differences.
Ultimately, a well-designed ACI should help the LM agent understand the state of the application
given previous changes, manage history to avoid unnecessary context from prior observations, and
provide actions that models can use efficiently and reliably. The ACI specifies both the commands
available to the LM and how the environment state is communicated back to the LM. It also tracks
the history of all previous commands and observations and, at each step, manages how these should
be formatted and combined with high-level instructions into a single input for the LM.
In this paper, we assume a fixed LM and focus on designing the ACI to improve its performance.
This means that we shape the actions, their documentation, and environment feedback to complement
an LM’s limitations and abilities. We draw inspiration from the field of HCI, where user studies
elicit insights about how compatible different interfaces are with respect to human intuition and
performance [7]. We use two approaches to enhance performance on a development set: (1) manually
inspect agent behavior to identify difficulties and propose improvements, and (2) run a grid search to
select the best ACI configuration.
Taking these two actions resulted in several insights about design principles that seem especially
important for building effective ACIs:

1. Actions should be simple and easy to understand for agents. Many bash commands have
   documentation that includes dozens of options. Simple commands with a few options and concise
   documentation are easier for agents to use, reducing the need for demonstrations or fine-tuning.
   This is a defining principle for all SWE-agent commands that we describe in Section 3.
2. Actions should be compact and efficient. Important operations (e.g., file navigation, editing)
   should be consolidated into as few actions as possible. Efficient actions help agents make
   meaningful progress towards a goal in a single step. A poor design would therefore have many
   simple actions that must be composed across multiple turns for a higher order operation to take
   effect. We show this idea in action in the Editing and Search interface analyses in Section 5.1.
3. Environment feedback should be informative but concise. High quality feedback should
   provide the agent with substantive information about the current environment state (and the effect
   of the agent’s recent actions) without unnecessary details. For instance, when editing a file,
   updating the agent about revised content is helpful. Figures 3a, 3b and Table 3 show this.
4. Guardrails mitigate error propagation and hasten recovery. Like humans, LMs make mistakes
   when editing or searching and can struggle to recover from these errors. Building in guardrails,
   such as a code syntax checker that automatically detects mistakes, can help agents recognize and
   quickly correct errors. We show the effect of editing guardrails in Table 3.

Analysis and ablation studies in Section 5 demonstrate how alternative ACIs affect LM performance.
Our studies shows how these principles appear recurrently across actions, feedback, and workflows.


3    SWE-agent: Designing an ACI for Software Engineering

Here we describe how SWE-agent provides an ACI for LMs to act as software engineering agents,
enabling them to effectively search, navigate, edit, and execute code commands. The ACI com-
prises several principal components, including search/navigation, file viewer, file editor, and context
management. At each step, SWE-agent generates a thought and a command, then incorporates the
feedback from the command’s execution in the environment (ReAct; Yao et al. [62]). Built atop the
Linux shell, SWE-agent also allows access to common Linux commands and utilities when needed.
Search and navigation. Navigating codebases requires finding the relevant file and content. A
common strategy to do this involves looking up terms that might be useful, e.g., files, functions,
or class definitions mentioned in an issue. We introduce the special commands find_file,
search_file, and search_dir, which output a summary of search results when searching
for filenames and strings within files or directories. Figure 10 shows examples of these search
result formats. The find_file command searches for filenames in the repository, while the
search_file and search_dir locates strings in a file(s) of a subdirectory. Our interface
encourages efficient searches by suppressing verbose results. The search commands return at most 50

results for each search query; if a search exceeds this number, we do not report the results and instead
suggest that the agent write a more specific query.
File viewer. After finding a file they want to view, agents use the interactive file viewer by calling
the command open on the relevant file path. The file viewer presents a window of at most 100
lines of the file at a time. The agent can move this window with the commands scroll_down and
scroll_up or access a specific line with the goto command. To facilitate in-file navigation and
code localization, we display: the full path of the open file, the total number of lines in the file, the
number of lines omitted before and after the current window, and the line number (prepended to each
visible line). Figure 3a shows an example of this interface.
File editor. We provide a few commands that let LMs create and edit files. The edit command
works in conjunction with the file viewer, allowing agents to replace a specific range of lines in the
open file. This command takes 3 required arguments: the start line, end line, and replacement text. In
a single step, agents can replace all lines between the start and end lines with the replacement text,
as shown in Figure 3b. After edits are applied, the file viewer automatically displays the updated
content, helping the agent observe the effects of its edit immediately without invoking additional
commands. Figure 3b shows an example agent response, including a file edit.
Similar to how humans can use tools like syntax highlighting to help them notice format errors when
editing files in an IDE, we integrate a code linter into the edit function to alert the agent of mistakes
it may have introduced when editing a file. Select errors from the linter are shown to the agent along
with a snippet of the file contents before/after the error was introduced. Invalid edits are discarded,
and the agent is asked to try editing the file again.
Context management. The SWE-agent system uses informative prompts, error messages, and history
processors to keep agent context concise and informative. Agents receive instructions, documentation,
and demonstrations on the correct use of bash and ACI commands. At each step, the system instructs
them to generate both a thought and an action [62]. Malformed generations trigger an error response,
shown in Figure 32, asking the agent to try again, which is repeated until a valid generation is received.
Once received, all past error messages except the first are omitted.
The agent’s environment responses display computer output using the template shown in Figure 30;
however, if no output is generated, a specific message (“Your command ran successfully and did
not produce any output”) is included to enhance clarity. To further improve context relevance,
observations preceding the last 5 are each collapsed into a single line, shown in Figure 31. By
removing most content from prior observations, we maintain essential information about the plan
and action history while reducing unnecessary context, which allows for more interaction cycles and
avoids showing outdated file information. §A provides further implementation details.

4   Experimental Setup
Datasets. We primarily evaluate on the SWE-bench dataset, which includes 2,294 task instances
from 12 different repositories of popular Python packages [20]. We report our main agent results
on the full SWE-bench test set and ablations and analysis on the SWE-bench Lite test set, unless


                                                            4
otherwise specified. SWE-bench Lite is a canonical subset of 300 instances from SWE-bench that
focus on evaluating self-contained functional bug fixes. We also test SWE-agent’s basic code editing
abilities with HumanEvalFix, a short-form code debugging benchmark [32].
Models. All results, ablations, and analyses are based on two leading LMs, GPT-4 Turbo
(gpt-4-1106-preview) [34] and Claude 3 Opus (claude-3-opus-20240229) [6]. We
experimented with a number of additional closed and open source models, including Llama 3 and
DeepSeek Coder [14], but found their performance in the agent setting to be subpar. Many LMs’
context window is too small, such as Llama 3’s context window of 8k. GPT-4 Turbo and Claude
3 Opus have 128k and 200k token context windows, respectively, which provides sufficient room
for the LM to interact for several turns after being fed the system prompt, issue description, and
optionally, a demonstration.
Baselines. We compare SWE-agent to two baselines. The first setting is the non-interactive, retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG) baselines established in Jimenez et al. [20]. Here, a BM25 retrieval
system retrieves the most relevant codebase files using the issue as the query; given these files, the
model is asked to directly generate a patch file that resolves the issue.
The second setting, called Shell-only, is adapted from the interactive coding framework introduced in
Yang et al. [59]. Following the InterCode environment, this baseline system asks the LM to resolve
the issue by interacting with a shell process on Linux. Like SWE-agent, model prediction is generated
automatically based on the final state of the codebase after interaction.
Metrics. We report % Resolved or pass@1 as the main metric, which is the proportion of instances
for which all tests pass successfully after the model generated patch is applied to the repository [20].
We also report the $ Avg. Cost metric, the API inference cost incurred by SWE-agent averaged over
all successfully resolved instances. Due to budget constraints, we set the per-instance budget to $4; if
a run exceeded this budget, existing edits were submitted automatically.
Configuration search. During the design process of SWE-agent, we arrived at the final ACI design
through qualitative analysis of system behavior on a small set of hand-picked examples from the
development split of SWE-bench. For the remaining hyperparameter choices, we performed a sweep
over the window size, history processing, and decoding temperature, shown in §B.1.


5     Results

Across all systems, SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo achieves the best performance all-around, success-
fully solving 12.47% (286/2,294) of the full SWE-bench test set and 18.00% (54/300) of the Lite
split. As shown in Table 1, compared to RAG on Lite, SWE-agent is 8-13x more costly but yields a
6.7-fold improved % Resolved rate. An LM-friendly ACI’s value is confirmed by SWE-agent’s 64%
relative increase compared to Shell-only, both with GPT-4 Turbo.
In Table 2, SWE-agent yields strong performance on HumanEvalFix with 88.3% pass@1 rate.
Figure 4 reveals that average performance variance is relatively low, but per-instance resolution can
change considerably. More results are given in the appendix: §B.2 shows that the success rate is
uncorrelated to the issue age (controlling for possible test pollution), B.5 presents more details on
performance variance and pass@k, and B.7 discusses extra evaluation details.

5.1    Analysis of ACI Design

We perform several ablations of the SWE-agent interface, specifically with respect to the SWE-agent
w/ GPT-4 configuration, summarized in Table 3. Our case studies shed light on interesting agent
behavior along with the impact of different ACI designs.
Human user interfaces are not always suitable as agent-computer interfaces. Current LMs are
vulnerable to a number of pitfalls when searching for relevant content in a Linux shell environment.
Some exploration patterns (e.g., chains of cd, ls, cat) are extremely inefficient. grep or find
look ups can perform better but occasionally produce many lines of irrelevant results. We hypothesize
that better localization is possible with faster navigation and a more informative search interface.

      Token counts for different models are not directly comparable since they use different tokenizers.

Figure 5 compares the Shell-only setting to two different search interfaces. Iterative search, directly
inspired by traditional user interfaces for search, e.g., Vim or VSCode, shows results one by one via
the file viewer. Agents can look through results using next and prev actions. Each result displays
the matching line along with n surrounding lines of context. An advantage is that an agent can begin
editing directly after seeing the relevant code in its search. However, when given a large number of
search results, agents tend to look through every match exhaustively, calling next until each result
has been inspected. This inefficient behavior can exhaust an agent’s cost budget or context window,
leading to even worse performance than the not having additional search tools at all (15.7%↓ 2.3 for
No search vs. 12.0%↓ 6.0 with Iterative search).
Compact, efficient file editing is critical to performance. SWE-agent’s file editor and viewer are
designed to consolidate the editing process into a single command that enables easy multi-line edits
with consistent feedback and automatically updates the agent’s view of the file after editing. In the
No edit setting, editing options are restrictive and prone to errors; the primary methods available
are either replacing entire files through redirection and overwriting or using utilities like sed for
single-line or search-and-replace edits. Both methods have significant drawbacks. Redirection
involves copying and rewriting entire files for even minor changes, which is both inefficient and
error-prone. Although sed can facilitate specific edits, executing multi-line edits is cumbersome
and can lead to unintended consequences that are challenging to detect. Moreover, both strategies

Figure 6: Three different Edit interfaces for task instance sympy__sympy-24102. Editing with
bash commands requires several actions to successfully modify a file. The Editing component defines
an edit command that leverages the File Viewer component to replace the bash style of editing
workflow with a single command. Linting is beneficial for stymieing cascading errors that often start
with an error-introducing edit by the agent.


lack immediate feedback about file updates, making these silent operations potentially confusing
for models to interpret and increasing the risk of errors. Without SWE-agent’s file editor interface,
performance drops to (10.3% ↓ 7.7 ). We also find that agents are sensitive to the number of lines the
file viewer displays. Either too little content (30 lines, 14.3% ↓ 3.7 ) or too much (entire file, 12.7%
↓ 5.3 ) lowers performance.

Guardrails can improve error recovery. A prominent failure mode occurs when models repeatedly
edit the same code snippet. The usual suspect for this behavior is an agent introducing a syntax
error (e.g., incorrect indentation, extra parenthesis) via an errant edit. As discussed in Section 3, we
add an intervention to the edit logic that lets a modification apply only if it does not produce major
errors. We compare this interface with the No edit and edit w/o linting alternatives in Figure 6.
This intervention improves performance considerably (without linting, 15.0% ↓ 3.0 ).

5.2             Analysis of Agent Behavior

Recurring problem-solving patterns emerge when LMs are equipped with a useful, intuitive ACI. We
describe several model behaviors and problem-solving patterns that can be discerned from model
performance and each model’s corresponding trajectories.
Reproduction and/or localization is the first step. SWE-agent usually begins with either writing
reproduction code and/or localizing the issue’s cause to specific lines of code. As shown in Figure 7, all
trajectories begin with either create (reproduction) or find_file/search_dir (localization).
To reproduce, models will create a new file, add reproduction code to it with an edit, then run
with python; this is the most popular triple of actions in Table 8. Using this feedback along with file

 names and symbols in the issue description, an agent will start with a broad, directory-level keyword
 search, before then zooming into specific files and lines. This is reflected in Figure 22, where the most
 likely actions following localization sequences like (python, find_file) and (search_dir,
 open) are search_file and goto, indicative of how an agent “zooms in" on a bug. Extensive
 analysis on correlations between different groups of actions are discussed in §B.3.3
 Remaining turns are mostly “edit, then execute" loops. As exhibited in Figure 7, from turn
 5 onwards, the most frequent two actions for all turns are edit and python. Captured as high
 probability next actions following (edit, python) in Figure 22, additional localization operations
 are often interspersed across these later turns, where agents might look at more in-file code with
 search_file, scroll_up/down, or other files altogether with search_dir, find_file.
 This behavior usually arises in response to new information from re-running the reproduction script.
 Submissions are distributed normally from turn 10 onwards, although resolved task instances correlate
 more with earlier submits (see §B.3.1). A walk-through of common trajectory phases is in §B.3.2.
 Editing remains challenging for agents. A non-trivial minority of edit actions raise a linting error;
 out of 2,294 task instances, 1,185 (51.7%) of SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo trajectories have 1+ failed
 edits. While agents generally recover more often than not from failed edits, the odds of recovery
 decrease as the agent accumulates more failed edits. Recovery refers to a sequence of consecutive
 failed edits followed immediately by a successful edit. Any attempt at editing has a 90.5% chance
 of eventually being successful. This probability drops off to 57.2% after a single failed edit. More
 editing phenomena are discussed in §B.3.3, and data about agents’ generated fixes are in §B.6.
 Agents succeed quickly and fail slowly. We find that runs submitted relatively early are much more
 likely to be successful compared to those submitted after a larger number of steps or cost. We show
 in Table 15 the distribution of resolved and unresolved instances, including only instances that did
 not exhaust their budget. We observe that successful runs complete earlier and at a cheaper cost than
 unsuccessful ones. In general, successful instances solved by SWE-agent w/ GPT 4 finish with a
 median cost of $1.21 and 12 steps compared to a mean of $2.52 and 21 steps for unsuccessful ones.
 Furthermore, we find that 93.0% of resolved instances are submitted before exhausting their cost
 budget, compared to 69.0% of instances overall. For these reasons, we suspect that increasing the
 maximum budget or token limit are unlikely to substantially increase performance. More statistics
 about how trajectories typically conclude are in §B.9.
 Most failures are incorrect implementations. We use GPT-4o to automatically categorize unre-
 solved trajectories (SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo on SWE-bench Lite, n =248) into one of 9 manually
 defined categories described in Table 9. On a hand-labeled validation set, the LM’s judgment agrees
 with the authors’ on 87% of instances. From Figure 8, about half (52.0%) of unresolved instances
 fall into the Incorrect Implementation or Overly Specific Implementation categories, suggesting that
 agents’ proposed solutions often simply fail to functionally address the issue or are insufficiently
 general solutions. Cascading failed edits make up another 23.4% of failures. More details in §B.4.

6.1   Software Engineering Benchmarks

Code generation benchmarks, which evaluate models on the task of synthesizing code from natural
language descriptions, have served as a long-standing bellwether for measuring LM performance [5,
1, 15, 30]. Subsequent works have built upon the code generation task formulation to contribute
new benchmarks that translate problems to different (programming) languages [3, 49], incorporate
third-party libraries [25, 29], introduce derivative code completion tasks [18, 32], increase test
coverage [26], change the edit scope [8, 9, 64], and add robustness to dataset contamination [19].
Code generation problems are largely self-contained, with short problem descriptions (∼100 lines)
and corresponding solutions that are similarly brief, requiring nothing more complex than basic
language primitives. Tests are either handwritten or generated synthetically via fuzz testing. In recent
months, the rapid development of LMs has begun to saturate many of these benchmarks. For instance,
the top method solves 94.4% of HumanEval [70].
Gauging future trends with the code generation task paradigm can be limited by the simplicity of this
setting and cost of human-in-the-loop problem creation. In response, recent efforts have demonstrated
that software engineering (SE) can serve as a diverse, challenging testbed for LM evaluation [68, 20,
28]. Repository-level code editing introduces many reasoning challenges grounded in real SE subtasks,
such as spotting errant code and identifying cross-file relationships and understanding codebase-
specific symbols and conventions. As a field, SE has generally studied tasks in a more isolated
manner; prior benchmarks tended to frame problems in isolation from the rest of a codebase [21, 23].
We use SWE-bench because it unites many separate SE tasks, such as automated program repair [10,
40, 55], bug localization [4, 58], and testing [22, 46, 56] under a single task formulation that
faithfully mirrors practical SE. Furthermore, SWE-bench task instances are diverse, having been
automatically collected from real GitHub issues across 12 different repositories. In addition, SWE-
bench performance is based on rigorous, execution-based evaluation with human-written unit tests.

6.2   Language Models as Agents

The co-emergence of stronger LMs, increasingly challenging benchmarks, and practical use cases
have together motivated a paradigm shift in LMs’ inference setting. Instead of traditional zero/few-
shot generation, LM agents [17, 42, 47, 54] that interact with a real/virtual world have proliferated as
the default setting for web navigation [24, 33, 36, 41, 45, 61, 62, 71], computer control [35, 53, 57],
and code generation tasks [16, 50, 63].
Interaction and code generation are increasingly used together, with code as the modality of choice for
actions [48, 59], tool construction [13, 51, 69], and reasoning [39, 66, 67]. Coding agents have also
been applied to offensive security [11, 37, 60], theorem proving [44], and clinical tasks [38, 43, 52].
To the best of our knowledge, SWE-agent is the first work to explore language agents for end-to-end
software engineering (SE).

7     Discussion
We introduce SWE-agent, an agent composed of an LM and ACI capable of autonomously solving
software engineering tasks. Through our design methodology, results, and analysis, we demonstrate
the value of ACIs tailored to leverage LMs’ strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. Beyond empirical
applications, we hope the further study of ACIs can also make principled use of and contribute to our
understanding of language models and agents, analogous to the synergy between human-computer
interaction (HCI) and psychology [2]. Humans and LMs have different characteristics, training
objectives, specialities, and limitations [12, 31], and the interaction design processes can be seen as
systematic behavioral experimentation that could reveal more insights into these differences towards
establishing a comparative understanding of human and artificial intelligence.

In the appendix, we provide additional analyses and more extensive discussions about SWE-agent,
agent-computer interface (ACI) design, and model performance on various evaluation benchmarks.
We also provide several thorough case studies of SWE-agent behavior on select task instances. Data,

For a quick, text-free overview, comprehensive documen-
tation for all commands, their usage, and docstrings are included in Table 4. Figure 9 visualizes the
message history for SWE-agent. Each prompt template is discussed thoroughly in Section C.

File viewer. As discussed in Section 3, the File Viewer is fundamental to a language agent’s ability
to understand file content and understand how different programmatic entities relate to one another.
The File Viewer refers to an interface that consists of the four commands, as shown in Table 4, and a
customized standard output for displaying n lines of a file at a time. Using the file viewer, an agent
can look at n lines of a file at a time and jump around the file. The File Viewer enables agents to
perform fine-grained localization steps and also understand relationships between intra-file entities.
First, we discuss why existing software systems and graphical user interfaces are sub-optimal for
LM use. In a Shell-only setting, there are several commands that can be used to inspect file content.
However, out of the box command line tools are sub-optimal or limiting for language agents for

several reasons. First, commands that print files to standard output (e.g. cat, printf) can easily
flood a language agent’s context window with too much file content, the majority of which is usually
irrelevant to the issue. Enabling a language agent to filter out distractions and focus on relevant code
snippets is crucial to generating effective edits. While commands like head and tail reduce length
to the first/last n lines, it is not intuitive to use bash commands to perform in-file navigation. It is
either impossible or requires a long list of arguments to show specific file lines. Furthermore, since
such Bash commands are stateless, “scrolling" up/down relative to the current file position typically
requires regenerating the same lengthy command with minor changes. Interactive tools like more
and less accommodate this, but (1) representing navigation actions (multiple key up/down clicks)
is intuitive for humans, but is verbose and costly for language agents, and (2) even if jumping to a
specific line number is allowed, it is not possible to quickly identify what classes/methods/symbols
are declared in a file and then immediately go to their definitions.
There are a couple features of the File Viewer interface that make it friendlier and more operable
than the Shell-only setting. First, the File Viewer standard output contextualizes code snippets with
prepended line numbers and indicators of the number of lines above/below the current region. These
details give a more focused view of a file without compromising easy viewing of other parts of the
codebase. This kind of file presentation also makes precise and consistent editing commands possible,
as we discuss more thoroughly in the following section.

Figure 10: The File Viewer and Search components of the SWE-agent interface. The corresponding
commands for each component are shown in blue. These examples are copied from trajectories
generated by SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo on the pvlib__pvlib-python-1603 task instance.


Another advantage of the File Viewer is that the commands are designed to be complementary and
grounded in the File Viewer standard output. This saves the model from having to do repetitive or
additional actions that unnecessarily increase the potential for error. As a concrete example, if an
agent used a sed command to view the first 100 lines of a file and wants to look at the next 100
lines, it will have to recalculate parameters such as the start line and end line and reflect these updates
correctly in the subsequent generation. As a rule of thumb, reducing the need for models to do this
arithmetic by constructing actions and standard output that complement one another and build upon
the effects of prior actions is highly preferable.

File editor. The File Editor, working in conjunction with the File Viewer, primarily refers to the
edit command and the guardrails it enforces to protect models against self-incurred cascading edit
errors. Editing and testing are crucial to language agents’ success on programming tasks, and a
well-designed interface directly influences how well an agent’s capabilities can be elicited. In other
words, a bad interface undermines model performance.
As discussed in Section 3, editing can be very difficult in a Shell-only setting. Built in commands
(e.g., sed) often require a lengthy list of arguments, and the mis-specification of an argument can
easily throw a model off track as it attempts to correct self-incurred errors. We also observe that when
agents use such commands directly, they struggle with the arithmetic skills required to generate an
edit. Details such as including the correct indentation level, inserting delimiters at specific points in a
line, and adhering to stylistic preferences of the codebase all require some amount of planning or
calculation. Similar to the Shell-only file viewing process, file editing may also require repeating
many commands. For instance, performing a multi-line edit can only be represented as multiple
sed calls with requisite, delicate tweaks to the arguments for every turn. Furthermore, as referenced
in Section 5.1, editing in Shell-only is usually a “silent" procedure. Confirming whether an edit
succeeded and viewing its effects requires additional steps that can bloat the editing process with
extra, needless commands.
The edit command, documented in Table 4, addresses the Shell-only failure modes by being
grounded in the File Viewer standard output. The line numbers argument eliminates the need for any
additional arithmetic, and the find-and-replace edit mechanism is a format that existing models are
more used to. With this functionality, agents can also perform multi-line edits in a single action.
Finally, as mentioned in Section 5.2, an important feature of the edit command is that it does not
apply changes which incur a linting error. A fair and verified assumption we make when considering
this feature is that the original codebase associated with each task instance is well-formed. In other


                                                                            18
words, we assume that codebase maintainers will only push syntactically sound code that can be
compiled successfully. When an agent issues an edit, it is applied to the codebase. Then, we run the
following linting command (CURRENT_FILE refers to the file that is currently open):
flake8 --isolated --select=F821,F822,F831,E111,E112,E113,E999,E902
"$CURRENT_FILE" 2>&1
The arguments for select are error codes that refer to syntax issues such as indentation. F821 and
F822 indicate undefined names/symbols. F831 indicates a duplicate argument in a function definition.
E111, E112, E113 are indentation errors. E999 denotes a syntax error and an E902 occurs if flake8
cannot read the source file.
If the edit does not introduce any of these errors, this command will produce no output. The edit
is kept and the updated file content is shown using the File Viewer centered around the lines the
edit occurred. If however the linting command produces output, which indicates the edit introduces
a syntax error, the edit is reverted. In place of the file viewer, a message shown in Figure 11 is
displayed to the agent which shows the error that was caused, what the edit would have looked like,
and the original file content. During the development process, we experimented with variations
to this message, including the omission of one or more parts. Our takeaway was that having all
three messages is helpful. Without the error type, the agent might misdiagnose what the mistake
was. Without a snippet of the changed file content, the agent will re-issue the same command more
frequently. Without a snippet of the original file content, the agent has to attend to the same content
from several turns ago; agents also sometimes generate edit’s with respect to wrong, errant file
content because it is from a more recent turn.

Figure 11: A linting error message. This is emitted if a model generates an edit command that
introduces a syntax error into the codebase. The error message shows the before and after of the
proposed edit along with what error messages were thrown. The problem with this edit is that it omits
the orientation_strategy field in its edit of the basic_chain method definition.
The editing guardrail has a drawback. To a certain degree, it forces some edits to be done in a
particular order. For instance, in Figure 11, if the model’s intention was in fact to remove the
orientation_strategy argument, due to the SWE-agent editing guardrails, it would have to
remove all references from the function implementation either at the same time in a single action,
or before removing it from the method header if split into two separate actions. For this particular
scenario, the latter is necessary because the file snippet is not large enough to show the entirety of the
basic_chain implementation. This example highlights the trade-offs between the flexibility and
guardrails of a command. Deciding whether to introduce a guardrail depends on how well it reduces
common model errors compared to whether such restrictions hamper models’ preferred workflows.

Search & navigation. The File Viewer and File Editor together allow agents to make edits, write
tests, and perform localization at a file level. The Search & navigation module complements these
capabilities by giving agents the tools to perform keyword-driven localization at both a directory
level and file level.
As discussed, the main struggles with using built in Shell-only search commands such as grep and
find are (1) given a general enough term, they are prone to producing too many search results
that can consume an inordinate amount of space in the context window, and (2) they are highly
configurable, making search result outcomes potentially inconsistent in appearance. The alternative
to these search utilities is to navigate the file system directly with cd and look at what’s in each
folder with variations of ls and cat; this kind of approach can take a large number of turns without
yielding any particularly useful information.
Figure 10 visualizes the standard output for the three different search commands. The search_dir
and find_file helps agents perform directory level searches. The reason we provide two com-
mands is due to the kinds of keywords that are present in an issue description (e.g., class references,
file names). The search_file command allows agents to search for terms at a file-level, which is
helpful for efficient fine-grained localization. Taking a step back, the goal of these search commands
is to make it easy for the agent to utilize any signal (e.g., line number, stack trace, natural language)
about the root cause of an issue that may be present in the issue description or codebase. Once again,
simpler command usage patterns with consistent output formats are easier for agents to use and
reduces the chance for mistakes or irrelevant outputs.
The main guardrail in place for all three search commands is curbing the number of search results
to 50 or fewer. The downside is that reporting an error forces the model to generate another search
query which can be an expensive operation. This reflects a trade-off between keeping observations
concise and making additional calls to the base LM.

A.2   Implementation

The SWE-agent codebase is generally composed of three modules: the environment, the agent, and
the logging mechanism for saving task episodes into trajectories and patch generations.


                                                   20
Environment. The SWE-agent environment is heavily influenced by the InterCode library [59]. For
the general pipeline of agent interactions with the environment, our work directly adopts InterCode’s
interactive coding task formulation. The environment integrates large parts of the interaction handling
logic from the InterCode-Bash environment, which is essentially the Shell-only setting referenced in
the paper. As a part of this adoption, SWE-agent also uses Docker containers to ensure reproducible
and safe execution. Because of this, SWE-agent’s infrastructure makes it easy for a user to swap
out the Dockerfile (a domain specific language for defining a container) to support other codebases
and programming languages beyond the scope of SWE-bench task instances. One difference is that
SWE-agent makes minor adjustments to the underlying communication logic that transfers actions
and observations between the Docker container and agent entity.
Agent. Beyond serving as an agentic wrapper for facilitating multi-turn queries from an LM, the agent
module defines the functions that render the ACI (e.g., context management, commands, interface
logic, input/output format) and supports inference for closed/open, API-based/local language models.
The main workflow is to define an interface as a class and/or set of commands, which can then be
specified via a configuration file, discussed more thoroughly in Section A.3. The commands for the
top performing SWE-agent with GPT 4 configuration are shown in Table 4.
Logging. For each task episode, the main artifacts produced are the trajectory, which contains a
history of the interactions between the agent and environment, and the final patch generation, which
can represents a summary of the changes proposed by the agent during the interaction. The patch
generation can be used directly for SWE-bench [20] evaluation.

A.3   Configuration

The SWE-agent system is instantiated by three components: an LM, a SWE-bench style dataset or
GitHub issue, and a configuration file. The configuration file serves to specify the design of the ACI.
Iteratively refining the configuration file is the main way we achieved better agent performance and
carried out different analyses for the main paper. In this section, we will present a thorough review of
what a SWE-agent configuration file looks like.
An agent-computer interface is generally made up of four categories of configurable components:

      1. Prompt templates: These prompt templates are used to inform the language model of the
         task setting, show the list of available commands, augment environment responses with the
         values of state variables, and provide the initial task setting.
      2. Command files: These files contain the source code of bash or Python functions and scripts.
         Commands are easily modified, added, and removed through manipulating these files’ code
         contents directly. Documentation added in these files can also be injected into prompts to
         inform the model of the available commands.
      3. Control flow: Methods for parsing model responses and processing history can be specified

Figure 12: An example of the configuration file that defines the SWE-agent ACI. A configuration
is represented as a single .yaml file, allowing you to define the commands that agents may use,
write prompts shown to the agent over the course of a single trajectory, and control the input/output
interface that sits between the agent and environment.
The prompt templates are explained in detail in Section C. The environment variables and command
files work in tandem; environment variables make the interfaces stateful, and when commands
are invoked, the corresponding states are updated to reflect the changes to the environment and
interface. The parse_command, parse_function, and history_processor all reference
implementations declared within the agent module. The parse_command file describes how
command documentation should be presented to the agent. The parse_function is what enforces
the input/output formats for the agent. The history_processor points to the logic for controlling
and modifying the message history enforced at each turn throughout a single task episode.


                                                 22
The configuration-based workflow of SWE-agent makes it easy to test new ACIs by incorporating
novel commands, input/output formats, context managers, and more into the existing codebase. In
the following subsections, we showcase existing implementations of several of these components and
discuss how they can be extended.
Commands. We describe how to implement your own commands for the SWE-agent ACI. As
shown in the above Figure 12, commands are declared as a list of one or more file paths in the
command_files argument. Individual commands must be declared as separate functions in .py
or .sh files. Every command subscribes to the following skeleton code in Figure 13.

  Command Skeleton Code

  # @yaml
  # signature: [command] [argument(s)]
  # docstring: [Brief description of what your command does.]
  # arguments:
  #   [argument 1 name]:
  #       type: [type (i.e. integer, string)]
  #       description: [Brief description of this argument]
  #       required: [true|false]
  #   [argument 2 name]:
  #       ...
  [command]() {
      # Implementation here
  }


Figure 13: The skeleton code for defining a command that can be accessed in the SWE-agent ACI.
The function definition includes both the underlying implementation along with several arguments
that describe how to use the command, which is compiled into the System template’s command
documentation at run time.
The choice of Python or Bash based implementations of commands means they can be written to
do a wide variety of actions, and the use of Docker means that the commands and system can be
co-designed. Here is a list of guidelines around how to implement commands correctly.

      • Command arguments can be referenced via positional parameters notation (i.e. $1).
      • If there are no arguments, omit the arguments section.
      • The implementation for your command is unconstrained. There are no limitations on the
        form of the underlying command code.
      • The minimal documentation requirements are signature and docstring.
      • Global variables can be used to make stateful changes to the environment. For instance, for
        the commands associated with the File Viewer, you’ll see we define the CURRENT_LINE
        variable for the file viewer. This variable is modified across multiple commands, including
        open, goto, scroll_up, scroll_down, and edit.
      • Third party libraries can be freely imported and used by commands (e.g., flake8).
      • To show effects of a command, print to standard output (e.g., with echo). The command
        parsing logic is implemented such that it does not look for a return value.

Once the file path containing the command is added to command_docs as an argument, the
command is immediately available for use in subsequent task episodes. Including a demonstration
that uses more complicated commands can be helpful to showcase proper use and may increase the
frequency with which the agent uses the command.
Input/output format. The input/output format defines what a correctly formatted response for an
agent should look like. Selecting a suitable format greatly affects how well agents can interact with
the environment. The methods for communicating and enforcing the input/output format are separated
across several arguments. In Figure 12, the value of parse_function should point to a class
definition that enforces the format and actually parses the agent’s responses. Informing the agent of
the expectations around the input/output format should take place in system_template, and the
agent can be reminded of these standards via the format_error_template. New input/output
formats can be easily devised and enforced by updating these arguments to point to a new class or
display different natural language instructions.


                                                 23
Context management. Context management is implemented as a class within the agent module.
The history_processor argument allows one to specify which context manager to use via the
configuration file. Underneath the hood, the context manager is invoked per turn of the interactive
loop. From the entire recorded history of the agent’s interactions so far, the context manager
constructs the literal history to be fed to the agent to invoke the next response. The general design of
history_processors allows for easy experimentation towards more sophisticated strategies for
managing history.

B      Extended Results
In this section, we provide additional results, including performance marginalized against differ-
ent dimensions, patch generation statistics, and problem solving patterns reflected by SWE-agent
trajectories. Per analysis, we provide numerical or qualitative evidence that supports our findings,
describe our takeaways from each finding, and discuss both the strengths of SWE-agent relative to
prior baselines along with future directions based on improving common failure modes.

B.1     Hyperparameter Sweep

We performed a hyperparameter sweep using a subset of 37 instances sampled randomly from the
dev split of SWE-bench. We present the results in Table 5, where we perform the sweeps for
both the GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus models. For GPT-4 Turbo the best configuration has
a % Resolved rate of 15.1%, with a temperature of 0.0, window length of 100 and history set to
last five observations (described in §3). There is a three way tie for Claude 3 Opus between the
aforementioned configuration along with two additional settings (Temperature/Window/History of
0.2/100/Last-5 and 0.2/200/Full). We elect to run inference of both models on the SWE-bench test
sets (both full and Lite splits) using the 0.0/100/Last-5 configuration.

the mean score across 5 samples.

B.2     Model Performance

We present analyses of model performance marginalized across different dimensions and categories.

Performance by Repository. We include a breakdown of model performance by repository on
the SWE-bench Lite dataset in Table 6. We also include and adjust the performance of Claude 2 on
SWE-bench, inherited from the baseline performances established in the original work. As presented
above, SWE-agent performance is superior to prior approaches, solving not only a higher percentage
of problems across repositories, but also resolving problems in repositories that were previously
nearly or completely unsolved by prior retrieval augmented generation baselines used in the original
SWE-bench work (e.g. matplotlib, sympy/sympy).

Temporal Analysis. In Table 7, we provide a temporal breakdown that shows the % Resolved
statistics for task instances from different years. There is no clear correlation between a task instance’s

B.3     Trajectory Analysis

We present additional characterizations of trajectories corresponding to task instances that were
successfully resolved by SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo (unless otherwise specified).

B.3.1    Turns to Resolution
Figure 14 visualizes the distribution of the number of turns SWE-agent needed to complete task
instances that were successfully resolved. On the full SWE-bench test set, SWE-agent w/ GPT-4
takes an average of 14.71 turns to finish a trajectory, with a median of 12 turns and 75% of trajectories
being completed within 18 turns. On the Lite split of the SWE-bench test set, SWE-agent w/ Claude
3 Opus takes an average of 12.71 turns to finish a trajectory, with a median of 13 turns and 75% of
trajectories being completed within 15 turns. From the distribution, it is evident that across models
and SWE-bench splits, the majority of task instances are typically solved and completed comfortably
within the allotted budget.
This also points to a general area of improvement for language agent systems — if a language agent’s
initial problem solving approach, typically reflected in the first 10 to 20 turns, does not yield a good

solution, it struggles to make use of later turns that build upon past mistakes. To remedy this issue
and induce stronger error recovery capabilities in language agents, future directions could consider
improving either the model, the ACI, or both.

B.3.2               Walkthrough of Trajectory Phases
We describe what happens in different phases of an agent’s problem solving trajectory. To support
our observations, we present several tables and distributions that help highlight consistent trends.
Initial reproduction, localization steps. First, the initial steps that SWE-agent usually takes is
heavily dominated by Localization and Reproduction operations. The most commonly occurring
pattern in general is the create, edit, python triplet. Across these commands, an agent creates
an empty python file, adds an executable code snippet via edit, and then attempts to run it. As an
alternative, the agent also sometimes decides to start off instead with Localization, or identifying the
files/lines causing the issue. Depending on how informative the issue description and results for initial
search queries are, agents will run additional search queries with finer grained search tools to zoom in
on the target problematic code area (e.g., search_dir, open, search_file/scroll_down).
These trends are also reflected in Figure 16, which shows a distribution of patterns across turns
according to the categories defined in Table 8. The three leftmost bars reflect that Reproduction
followed by Localization constitutes the lion’s share of operations that occur in the early phases of a
trajectory. For a more thorough breakdown, we also include Figure 17, which shows an estimated
distribution of each action with respect to different turns, normalized across the total number of times


                                                                                   27
Table 8: We present a table of the most frequently occurring action patterns at each turn (“frequently"
means ≥ 4 times) in trajectories of task instances resolved by SWE-agent w/ GPT-4. For instance,
the pattern create,edit,python appears 156 times at the first to third turns. In addition, we
also manually assign each entry a category (Reproduction, Localization (File), Localization (Line),
Editing, Submission) that generally captures the underlying purpose of such a pattern. “Reproduction"
refers to the sub-task of recreating the error or request described by the issue. “Localization" refers to
the sub-task of identifying the code that is the cause of the issue.

the command occurs across all turns. From these graphs, we can see that create is invoked much
more frequently in the very first turn than in any other turn. The search_dir and search_file
distributions are roughly bi-modal, with a peak of occurrences for both actions showing up in
Turn 1 (if the agent decides to do Localization immediately) and the Turn 4 (if the agent decides
to do Localization after Reproduction). We also present Figure 18, which communicates similar
information as Figure 17, but presented instead as a stacked bar chart with more commands. The
chart is created directly from Figure 7, with the frequency of actions at each turn n normalized across
the total number of trajectories with a length greater than or equal to n turns.

Figure 17: This density plot shows a normalized distribution of actions across different turns of
a trajectory. exit_cost refers to when the token budget cost was exhausted and the episode’s
changes are automatically submitted (contrary to an intentional submit invoked by the agent).

Cycle of edit, then evaluate. From the fifth turn onwards, the distribution of actions per turn can
be generally described as alternating edit and python/pytest actions. After reproducing the
issue and localizing the file(s) responsible for the problem, agents will typically make edits to the

file, then run the reproduction script or existing tests to check whether the proposed edits resolve
the original issue and maintain existing desirable behavior. This pair of actions will often repeat
for several turns, as an initial edit usually does not successfully resolve the given issue. Multiple
rounds of editing that are supplemented by execution feedback from prior turns are conducive to
more well-formed, successful subsequent edits. As reflected in Table 8, for turn 4 onwards, the most
popular pattern that begins at each turn usually falls under the Editing category. This is also made
obvious by Figure 18, where the edit command is the most popular command for Turns 5 to 31,
with only one exception (Turn 30). From Figure 17, it is also notably that the distributions of the
edit and python commands are quite similar, as they typically follow one another.

Figure 18: A normalized view of Figure 7. The distributions for turn n are normalized across the
number of trajectories that have a length of at least n or more turns.


Interspersed across these later turns are additional Localization operations for inspecting other
parts of the current file (e.g., scroll_down, scroll_up) or opening other files (e.g., open,
search_dir/file, find_file). These minor trend lines reflect the tasks that involve multi-
line or multi-file edits. Figure 18 displays a steady presence of such actions from Turn 6 onwards.
Agents will invoke such actions to read different parts (e.g., documentation, implementation) of a
long function, especially when it does not fit entirely within the file viewer’s number of lines. After
editing one function A, running the reproduction script will occasionally propagate an error in a
different function B, where function B invokes A. This is a common reason for the additional directory
and file level navigation that occurs in the later stages of a trajectory.
Concluding submission turns. There is a consistent proportion of submit actions per turn, with a
relative peak around Turn 10, as shown in Figure 17. As mentioned in Section 5.2 and above, the
majority of resolved task instances end with an intentional submit command. As suggested by
both Figure 15 and Figure 18, submissions are concentrated between Turns 10 and 20, becoming
less frequent for each turn beyond this range. This trend reflects how agents struggle to use later
turns to their advantage, particularly when the original problem solving approach fails, which is fairly
evident by Turn 20. Effectively utilizing later turns to either remedy multiple prior errors or pivot to a
different problem solving approach are all viable strategies given the 20+ turns that remain. However,
due to overwhelming context or greedy tendencies, agents do not reflect such dynamic behavior,
instead opting to focus on continued local editing rather than additional exploration.
Finally, there is a sharp cut off of exit_cost actions scattered throughout Turns 30 to 40; this
reflects that the $4 cost limit we impose on runs roughly corresponds to this number of turns. The
discrepancies mainly comes from variations in the size of observations, with trajectories containing
multiple observations that have a high number of tokens corresponding to ones that terminate relatively
earlier. Increasing the cost allowance per task episode would directly increase the maximum number
of the turns per episode.

B.3.3      Breakdowns of Action Sequences

In this part, we include more granular examinations of patterns of actions that emerge frequently in
trajectories. We also identify consistent associations between groups of actions and how their effects
build off one another across several turns.
Editing Trends. Editing is a core facet of agents’ ability to reproduce issues and propose fixes
effectively. It is also the action that models typically struggle with the most. Here, we list several
trends we were able to discern about how agents edit.
First, across the full SWE-bench test set, a non-trivial minority of edit actions are unsuccessful,
meaning the edit invocation raises a linting error. Going forwards, we refer to such an occurrence
as a failed edit. Out of 2,294 task instances, 1,185 (51.7%) have at least one turn with an failed edit.
Of these trajectories, there is a median of 3 failed edits per trajectory, with a max of 33. The rate of
failed edits is smaller for resolved task instances. Out of 286 resolved instances, 113 (31.5%) have at
least one turn with an failed edit, with a median/mean/max of 2 failed edits per trajectory, with a max
of 26. Figure 19 shows corresponding distributions.

Figure 19: Distribution of the number of failed edit actions per trajectory across all (left) and
resolved (right) task instances by SWE-agent with GPT-4 Turbo. A “failed" edit refers to an edit
action that raised a linting error. The left-most bar for both graphs corresponds to the number of
trajectories with no failed edits.

Second, with linting enabled editing, agents “recover" more often than not from failed edits. To
understand whether and how effectively agents use linting error feedback to construct a subsequent,
well-formed edit action, we define two terms. Recovery refers to a sequence of failed edits followed
immediately by a successful edit, suggesting the agent used linting feedback to make a well-formatted
edit. An unsuccessful recovery is consecutive failed edits followed immediately by a non-edit action.

n increases.


                                                                31
Across trajectories corresponding to resolved task instances, there are 135 occurrences of 1+ failed
edit attempts. Out of these, the agent recovers successfully 104 times. The number of consecutive
failed edit attempts before a successful versus failed recovery is also vastly different. Successful
recoveries are usually preceded by 2.03 edit attempts, less than the average 4.22 failed edit attempts
of unsuccessful recoveries. Across all task instances, the relative rate of unsuccessful recoveries
increases, with 810 successful recoveries versus 555 unsuccessful ones. While the number of
consecutive failed edit attempts resulting in a recovery remains steady (2.2), it increases significantly
for unsuccessful recoveries (5.59).
Third, the odds of recovery decreases as the agent accumulates more failed edit attempts. Figure 20
displays a line plot of the probability of a successful edit given n failed edit attempts in a row. The
leftmost data point of n = 0 means that any attempt at editing has a 90.5% chance of eventually
being successful. This value drops off once the agent incurs a single failed edit; there is only a 57.2%
chance the edit is ultimately successful. In other words, there is a 42.8% chance the agent never
recovers upon encountering 1 edit error.
Action sequence analysis. We calculate the transition probabilities showing the likelihood of the
next action given the previous n actions. To perform this analysis, we first determine the 15 most
commonly occurring sequences of n actions, for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. We then count how frequently each
command appears after this sequence and finally normalize the counts across the total number of
occurrences of the sequence to get a likelihood of the “Next Action" with respect to the preceding n
sequence of actions.
We show these transition probability heatmaps, with n = 1 in Figure 21, n = 2 in Figure 22, n = 3
in Figure 23, and n = 4 in Figure 24. From these graphs, it is immediately obvious that several
action sequences emerge consistently across many task instances. The high likelihood cells in these
heatmaps suggest that SWE-agent uses common problem solving patterns which correspond to higher
order operations such as reproducing an issue, localizing buggy code, and proposing/verifying edits.
In Figure 21, we see direct associations between pairs of actions. There are several obvious trends.
All trajectories begin with create, find_file, search_dir, and end on either a submit
or exit_cost. The most popular next action is edit; it is the most likely action to follow
create, edit, goto, pytest, and python. Scroll (e.g., scroll_down/up) and search (e.g.
find_file, search_dir) actions tend to be repeated.
Other interesting correlations are also present. The edit/evaluate pattern is reflected in the correlation
between the edit and python pair. A variety of localization patterns are also conspicuous.
Sometimes, searching for a file turns out to be less fruitful than searching for a keyword, and visa
versa. This is reflected in the find_file and search_dir pair. The invocation of open is
representative of an agent honing in on a specific file to then continue localizing (search_file
0.35, scroll_down 0.18, goto 0.09) or begin editing (edit 0.25).
As the number of prior actions considered increases, more complex operations carried across multiple
commands become apparent, echoing the observations from Table 8. In Figure 23, reproduction
(e.g. [create, edit, python]) is typically followed by adjustments to the script (edit 0.39) or
localization (find_file 0.31, search_dir 0.22). Fruitful localization patterns are once again
reflected by [find_file / search_dir, open, search_file] are followed by goto. In
Figure 24, the most popular 4-grams are related to reproduction or editing. The [edit, python,
rm, submit] pattern is a popular way for trajectories to finish. Common failure modes are also
apparent; repeated actions like edit (4x) and scroll_down (4x) typically continues cascading.

B.4    Failure Modes

In this section, we provide insight on categorizing common agent failure modes. We perform an
automated analysis of the unresolved trajectories (n = 248) from the SWE-bench Lite split with our
default configuration. We first create a list of possible failure categories based on model behavior
analyzed in Sections B.3.2, which are described in full detail in Table 9. A validation set of 15
instances are then sampled from the 248 instances left marked unresolved by SWE-agent and the
authors hand-label them according to these categories. Finally, we combine the agent’s trajectory
with the patch generated by its changes and the gold patch for reference and use an LM to categorize

      We use gpt-4o-2024-05-13 from OpenAI.

validation set, the LM generated labels agree with the authors’ labels on 87% of instances.
We find that about half (52.0%) of the unresolved instances fall into the Incorrect Implementation or
Overly Specific Implementation categories, suggesting that agents’ proposed solutions often simply
fail to functionally address the issue or are insufficiently general solutions. Another significant
category is the Failed Edit Recovery category, making up 23.4% of instances, which happens when
models fail to generate well-formed edits to files, which can seriously inhibit their performance. The
remaining failure modes make up less than 25% of instances, but highlight different aspects of the
challenges faced by the agent in the problem-solving process.

B.5   Performance Variance and Pass@k Rate

Since running SWE-agent on SWE-bench can be rather expensive, we perform, all results, unless
otherwise stated, are reported using a pass@1 metric (% Resolved). However, we also test our main
SWE-agent configuration for a higher number of runs to test the variance and pass@k performance
for k ∈ {3, 6}. These results are shown in Table 10, suggesting that average performance variance is
relatively low, though per-instance resolution can change considerably.


Table 10: Performance for 6 separate runs of SWE-agent with GPT-4 on SWE-bench Lite. The %
Resolved rate for each individual run is shown in the first table, and the pass@k rate in the second.

B.6   Patch Generations

In this section, we present some statistics and analysis around the edits generated by SWE-agent.
At the end of a task episode, the edits made by SWE-agent are aggregated and saved as a single
.patch file, the canonical representation for code changes of a pull request on GitHub. From these
patch representations, we can quantitatively characterize an agent’s generations and see how they
compare to the original solutions written by human codebase maintainers.
Table 11 presents a summary of four basic statistics about the model generations. Lines added and
lines removed refer to the total number of lines that were added or deleted in the patch, an indicator of
the size of the modification. The number of hunks and files is more indicative of how many “regions"
of the codebase were modified. A higher number of hunks and files suggests that there are more
distinct, separate places in the codebase where the patch made changes. For both “Resolved" and
“All" categories of task instances, models tend to generate “larger" edits (e.g., more lines added,
hunks, and files) than the corresponding gold solution. Prior RAG baselines in Jimenez et al. [20]
typically produce smaller edits on average. The source of this increase for agent-generated solutions
can largely be attributed to additional reproduction code.


Table 11: We show the (median) / (mean) value for several statistics characterizing patch generations.
We calculate these statistics across two dimensions. First, the “Resolved" / “All" labels denote
whether the patch resolved the issue. Second, for the task instances specific to each model, we
calculate the same statistics across the gold patches. To diminish the effect of outliers, we calculate
these statistics based on values falling within within the 90th percentile of the distribution.

When comparing the “Resolved" and “All" categories, we see that successfully resolved edits are
relatively smaller than the original distribution. This trend is consistent with the RAG based solutions;
issues that require multiple edits across a codebase remains challenging for agents.

B.7   HumanEvalFix Evaluation

In this section, we include further discussion about our evaluation of SWE-agent on HumanEvalFix.
We choose to evaluate on the HumanEvalFix task because it focuses on code editing and debugging,
which was empirically demonstrated in Muennighoff et al. [32] to be a more difficult task for LMs (as
reported in their work, GPT 4 scores 78.3% on HumanEval, compared to 47.8% on HumanEvalFix).
The code editing task can also be thought of as a “subtask" in SWE-bench; being able to identify and
fix bugs is a major part of software engineering.
We adopt the HumanEvalFix dataset (164 problems per language) to be compatible with the SWE-
agent setting. Following the documentation in Muennighoff et al. [32], SWE-agent is initialized in
a directory with a single file containing a buggy code snippet and example test(s) if available. It is
then asked to edit the code and verify its fixes. The configuration file is identical to the one used
for SWE-bench, with the exception of a language-specific demonstration. For this task, localization
and navigating a large codebase are not necessary; the main focus is on generating the correct
edit. SWE-agent achieves the best performance on the HumanEvalFix benchmark for three of the
languages we evaluate on, as shown in Table 2. Figure 25 also suggests that the large majority of task
instances are solved within the first 10 turns.

B.9           Miscellaneous

In this section, we include additional minor analyses around agent behavior and their generations.
Agents are better at localizing files than BM25. The interactive setting also enables agents to
identify the correct file(s) to edit more often compared to the RAG baselines in Jimenez et al. [20].
To measure this, we calculate the F1 score between the set of [edited, removed] files by the agent’s
prediction versus the gold patch. SWE-agent w/ GPT-4 Turbo achieves an F1 score of 59.05%, while
BM25 w/ Claude 3 Opus produces an F1 score of just 45.47%.
Most resolved task instances are intentionally submitted. There are four ways a task episode ends.

                  • “Submit" refers to a task episode that ends when the agent generates the submit command.
                  • “Exit Cost (Submit)" refers to the scenario where the episode ends because the cost limit
                    was hit, and the changes so far are gathered and submitted as an edit.
                  • “Exit Cost (No Submit)" refers to when the cost limit was hit and no edit’s were made, so
                    there was nothing to submit. In this scenario, the instance is guaranteed to be unresolved.
                  • “Early Exit" refers to when the task episode terminates because an agent issued too many
                    malformed responses in a row. Any changes are submitted as an edit.

Table 13 shows the counts for the number of trajectories that ended on these four different outcomes,
categorized across the agent, SWE-bench split, and whether or not that task instance was resolved. For
SWE-agent with GPT-4 Turbo, the majority of “All" task instances are submit. For the trajectories
corresponding to“All" task instances by SWE-agent with Claude 3 Opus, slightly less than 50% of
task instances are submitted, while the slight majority are auto-submitted when the cost limit is hit.


                                                                      37
Table 13: This table showcases the counts for the four ways (“Submit", “Exit Cost (Submit)", “Exit

However, these trends do not hold for “Resolved" task instances. For SWE-agent with both models,
the large majority of these task instances are submit. Reiterating the conclusion in Section 5.2 and
prior visualizations in Section B.3, we see here again that resolved task instances often imply that the
agent is able to produce and verify an edit within the allotted number of turns. The SWE-agent ACI
is also effective at eliciting well-formed thoughts and actions from agents. Across all runs, there are
only two “Early Exit" occurrences, where the episode terminated because the agent generated too
many malformed responses in a row.
Finally, Table 13 also upholds an expected trend. Task instances that finish with a submit action are
more likely to be resolved than those that are cutoff by cost. For instance, for SWE-agent with GPT-4
Turbo on full SWE-bench, 14.3% of task instances that end with a submit are resolved, which is
much higher than 3.1% for those finishing on exit_cost.

C      Prompts
In this section, we go through the prompt templates that make up the agent’s history, discussing
them in the order of presentation to SWE-agent. Per template, we describe its purpose, walk through
its content, and note any additional motivations that influenced how we wrote the template. The
companion figures of template content are all drawn from our default configuration, using SWE-agent
w/ GPT-4.
The template content can and should be adapted slightly to fit the agent’s intended use case. The
purpose of this section is to describe our thought process for how we designed each template for these
tasks to serve as reference for future work. Across templates, we find that providing tips which tell
agents to not make specific mistakes, avoid common pitfalls, and use helpful execution signals are
effective for eliciting more successful problem solving.
Prompt Workflow. We present Figure 26 which shows the order in which different prompt templates
are invoked. This flow of prompts reflects the logic that generates trajectories similar to the one that
is visualized in Figure 9.

Figure 26: The flow of prompt templates throughout a single SWE-agent task instance episode.
The system, demonstration, and issue templates are shown all together at the beginning of the task
episode, followed by turn-specific prompts that are shown depending on whether the agent response
is well-formatted and whether the action has standard output.

System Template. The system template describes the interactive task setting, the commands at the
agent’s disposal, and the expected response format. It is the first message for any episode, does
not change in content across task instances, and is not removed or collapsed at any point from the
message history. The agent is told of the general task setting, which is a command line that comes
with a special file viewer interface. After this, the agent is presented the command documentation,
which shows a usage example and docstring for every custom command, mirroring the content of
Figure 27. As discussed before, from manual observation, we find that agents need a lot of support to
make effective use of the edit command.
    System Prompt
    SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you’re working directly in the command line with a
    special interface.
    The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time. In addition to
    typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.
    COMMANDS: {documentation}
    Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you’d like to add the
    line ‘      print(x)’ you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is
    important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.
    RESPONSE FORMAT:
    Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
    (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $
    You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command. Your output should always
    include one discussion and one command field EXACTLY as in the following example:



                                                              39
  DISCUSSION
  First I’ll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some
  relevant files to see what they look like.
  ```
  ls -a
  ```
  You should only include a SINGLE command in the command section and then wait for a response from the
  shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION
  section will be saved for future reference. If you’d like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT
  DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you’ll be
  able to issue the second command. You’re free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,
  cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above. However, the environment does NOT support
  interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Figure 27: The system prompt for SWE-agent describes the environment. The documentation
field is populated with brief description of all enabled commands, similar to Table 4.
An agent will occasionally generate an edit with either the wrong level of indentation or incorrectly
specified line numbers. Because of this, we include a note telling the agent to pay attention to
proper indentation. Finally, the system prompt describes what the agent’s response should look
like, communicated with an example (e.g. JSON format, XML delimiters) followed by a paragraph
reinforcing the importance of issuing a single thought/action pair per turn. Because of the constraints
imposed by Docker containers, we include one last point about the command line environment not
supporting any interactive session commands, such as vi or python. The system template does not
introduce any task instance specific information.
Demonstration Template. If provided, the demonstration template immediately follows the system
template as the second message showing the agent a trajectory which resulted in the successful
resolution of a task instance from the development set. As confirmed by the ablation in Table 3,
including a demonstration slightly helps agents with understanding proper command usage and
reduces the rate of errant responses. Rather than being written out entirely like the system template,
the demonstration template is put together based on two fields as shown in the configuration file
discussed in Section A.3. First, the demonstrations argument points at 1+ .traj file(s), each
containing a multi-turn, SWE-agent style history of interactions.
Second, the demonstration_template and put_demos_in_history arguments control
how the demonstration is represented in the message history. If the put_demos_in_history
argument is set True, every turn of the demonstration trajectory is used as a separate message in
the history. The alternative is to write out the entire demonstration as a single message, wrapped in
a natural language instruction indicating it is a demonstration (this is the method that is displayed
in Figure 28). The effectiveness of each method varies by model. The first method of adding a
demonstration as separate messages can be preferable because it gives an agent the impression that it
has already solved a task instance and is working on the next one. However, for a different model, it
can be confusing to have the contexts from two tasks in a single trajectory, which is why the second
method of explicitly telling the model that it’s being given a demonstration can be better.

  Demonstration

  Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.
  It is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.

Figure 28: A simplified demonstration template showing how demonstrations are provided to the
model as a single message. Here we show only the final 3 turns in the demonstration for brevity.
We are unsure if demonstrations actually help agents understand the nuances of domain specific
problem solving. Because of the diversity of software engineering issues, we think the role the
demonstration plays is primarily to help the agent learn to issue properly formatted commands. Prior
work has demonstrated that fine tuning may have the potential to imbue agents with a certain degree
of expertise around how to adaptively solve task instances that may vary in terms of what strategy is
most successful.
Instance Template. The instance template introduces the agent to the task instance. The problem
statement is shown, followed by a brief set of instructions that reiterate important points from the
system template. These points are the one thought/action per-turn requirement, mentioning the lack
of support for interactive shell commands, and a reminder of the importance of editing indentation.
Finally, a notably effective part of the instance template is the inclusion of tips which serve as an
additional guidelines for how to operate successfully in the bash environment, shown in Figure 29.
These tips were developed manually and iteratively; after running SWE-agent with a particular
configuration on the development set, we manually looked at the trajectories for failure modes. The
tips were born out of these failures, and through repeated inspection, we found that such tips did
reduce the frequency of errant problem solving strategies that they are meant to address. While our
manual approach to writing tips certainly does not scale, representing feedback for common mistakes
as tips is surprisingly effective. Developing better methods for this process of identifying failure
modes and writing natural language instructions that describe the correct alternative behavior could
be an avenue to better performance for future SWE-agent based systems. Finally, at the end of the
message, the agent is presented with a command line prompt indicating that the task has begun and
that the agent should issue its first command.

,→  session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you
,→  can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python
,→  script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.

NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing
,→  a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each
,→  line!

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues
,→  discusses. If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we
,→  recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run
,→  it to make sure you can reproduce the bug. Then start trying to
,→  fix it. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug
,→  reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been
,→  fixed.

2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different
,→  command. A command that did not work once will not work the
,→  second time unless you modify it!

3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific
,→  line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just
,→  use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto
,→  583 command. It's much quicker.

4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a
,→  specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to
,→  understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the
,→  existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done
,→  that. Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png"
,→  If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.

5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the
,→  current working directory (which appears right after the
,→  currently open file). The currently open file might be in a
,→  different directory than the working directory! Note that some
,→  commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the
,→  current open file.

6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong
,→  line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always
,→  check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it
,→  reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue
,→  another command to fix it.

Figure 29: The instance template. This message shows the task instance’s problem statement
(referenced by the {issue} field), shows additional task instance-specific information, and provides
a set of tips suggesting recommended problem solving approaches and pitfalls to look out for.
Next Step Template. Assuming an agent’s response is well formed and contains an action, there
are two simple templates used to present the corresponding output of the agent’s action, as shown in
Figure 30. If an agent’s action produces some standard output, the agent is simply shown this output
with a command line prompt to indicate that the agent should respond with the next action.

  Next Step Template
  {OBSERVATION}
  (Open file: /path/to/open/file.py)
  (Current directory: /path/to/cwd)
  bash-$


Figure 30: The environment’s “next step" template. This is emitted after each observation to inform
the model of the current state of the shell and programs.
However, if an agent’s action runs silently and produces no output (e.g. rm abc.py, touch
abc.py), we found that simple showing no output along with a prompt can be confusing for agents
to interpret, and it will often run additional, unnecessary commands to determine the effect of the
prior action. To guard against this situation, the agent is informed verbosely that the command ran
successfully and did not produce output. While the System, Demonstration, and Instances template
are only used a single time, the next step template is used repeatedly. In the SWE-agent configuration
described in this work, the next step templates are fairly simple, as they essentially just add the
command line prompt to the end of the execution standard output. We have not explored other
variations to this style.
Collapsed Observation Template. As shown in Figure 9 and discussed in Section 2, old observations
are collapsed; meaning that the structure and order of the agent’s interaction history is preserved, but
the content of old observations are replaced with a one-line placeholder. This summary simply states
that the observation is omitted with the number of lines that were removed, as shown in Figure 31.

  Environment Response (collapsed) Template
  Old output omitted (101 lines)


Figure 31: A collapsed environment response. The content of old observations are replaced with this
template.
The purpose of collapsing old observations is twofold. First, it simply reduces the number of tokens
needing to be processed at each interaction step. Second, by removing old observations’ content, it
can also reduce the presence of outdated or duplicate information, such as directory and file contents
or command output. We think that both of these purposes can serve to improve agent performance.
Error Message Template. An agent’s response is not always well formed. As discussed, an agent is
generally expected to respond with a single thought and action per turn. In our work, we experimented
with asking the agent to generate one of three different styles of responses for communicating one
thought and one action (same type of response across any single episode).

      1. A string where the action is wrapped as a markdown-style code block (```).
      2. A JSON style dictionary with “thought" and “action" keys.
      3. An XML style generation with “<thought>" and “<action>" delimiters.

On occasion, an agent may generate a response that doesn’t conform to the requested format. If this
occurs, we show an error message to the agent indicating that the prior message was malformed and
to issue another response that does not make the same mistake, as presented in Figure 32. If a model
generates 3 malformed responses in a row, the episode will terminate early.



                                                  43
  Error Message
  Your output was not formatted correctly. You must always include one
  discussion and one command as part of your response. Make sure you do
  not have multiple discussion/command tags.
  Please make sure your output precisely matches the following format:
  DISCUSSION
  Discuss here with yourself about what your planning and what you're
  going to do in this step.

  ```
  command(s) that you're going to run
  ```

Figure 32: The environment’s error message. This is emitted if a model generation doesn’t conform
to the thought-action format suggested.
Another context management trick is that if models generate a malformed response, but then subse-
quently respond with a valid one, the message history is modified such that the action and response
correspond to the malformed generation is removed. This kind of de-noising reduces unnecessary
context and helps prevent future malformed generations. Each well-formatted response becomes an
additional in-context demonstration of how to interact with the environment correctly; this “momen-
tum” of correct responses is effective for helping agents continue to issue correct actions at later turns
in trajectories when there is a lot of information in the message history.

We choose 2 successful and unsuccessful task instances from SWE-bench Lite to perform a full
qualitative analysis, based on the trajectories generated by the default configuration using GPT-4
Turbo.

Analysis for psf/requests-2317

Issue Summary. The agent was tasked with resolving a problem in the requests library where the
method variable, a bytes object (e.g., b’GET’), was being incorrectly converted to a literal string
("b’GET’") by the builtin_str function. This caused the requests library to raise a 404
Not Found response due to the incorrect method string. The issue was observed in Python 3.4 and
not in Python 2.6, indicating a version-specific difference in handling bytes.
Interaction Summary
      1. Locate the Target File: The agent began by finding the sessions.py file in the
         requests library directory. It correctly identified that the relevant file was in the
         requests directory rather than the build directory.
      2. Search for the Issue: It opened sessions.py and used the search_file command
         to locate the builtin_str function call. It found the relevant line (line 428) where the
         method variable was being converted.
      3. Edit the Code: The agent edited the sessions.py file to check if the method was a
         bytes object and, if so, decoded it to ASCII before applying the builtin_str function.
      4. Test Changes: To verify the fix, the agent created a new file, reproduce_issue.py,
         which attempted to send an HTTP request using a binary method string. The script
         printed the response status code to check if the request was handled correctly. It ran
         the reproduce_issue.py script, which executed successfully and received a 200 OK
         response, indicating that the issue was resolved.
      5. Clean Up and Submit: Finally, the agent deleted the reproduction script and submitted the
         changes to the code base.
Evaluation. Upon evaluation, the agent’s proposed changes successfully pass the instance’s unit
tests. When comparing the agent’s generation to the ‘gold patch‘, we notice that the gold patch uses
the to_native_string function, defined in requests/utils.py#L655, which behaves identically to
the agent’s proposed changes. Ultimately, while the agent successfully resolves the issue, it fails to
use existing utility functions, which could lead to less maintainable or portable code in production.

    We’re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here’s the issue text:
    ISSUE:
    method = builtin_str(method) problem
    In requests/sessions.py is a command:
    method = builtin_str(method)
    Converts method from
    b’GET’
    to
    "b’GET’"
    Which is the literal string, no longer a binary string. When requests tries to use the method "b’GET’”, it
    gets a 404 Not Found response.
    I am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3). neutronclient is broken
    because it uses this "args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)" command which converts all the values to
    binary string, including method.
    I’m not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I’m starting here. Seems if
    requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn’t have any problem.
    Also, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn’t exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes
    this not work right.

To address the issue, we first need to replicate the behavior described. The issue mentions that the
‘builtin_str‘ function in ‘requests/sessions.py‘ is converting a binary string method like ‘b’GET’‘ into
the literal string ‘”b’GET”’‘, which is incorrect. We should start by locating the ‘sessions.py‘ file within
the ‘requests‘ library to examine the code around the ‘builtin_str‘ function call.
Let’s begin by finding the ‘sessions.py‘ file in the current repository.

find_file "sessions.py"

We have found two matches for ‘sessions.py‘. The one in the ‘build/lib/requests‘ directory is likely a
build artifact, and the one we’re interested in is probably ‘/psf__requests/requests/sessions.py‘. Let’s
open this file to inspect the code around the ‘builtin_str‘ function call.

We are now looking at the section of the ‘sessions.py‘ file where the ‘builtin_str‘ function is used to
 convert the ‘method‘ variable. According to the issue, this conversion is causing a problem when the
‘method‘ is a binary string because it’s being converted to a literal string that includes the binary prefix
‘b’...’‘.
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the ‘method‘ variable is correctly converted to a string
without the binary prefix. This might involve checking the type of the ‘method‘ variable and handling
 binary strings differently from regular strings.
 Let’s edit the line to add a check that ensures binary strings are decoded to regular strings before being
 passed to ‘builtin_str‘.

edit 428:428
        # Ensure method is a string, decode if it's a binary string
        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('ascii')
        method = builtin_str(method)

The edit has been made to decode binary strings before converting them to a string with ‘builtin_str‘.
This should prevent the issue where a binary string like ‘b’GET’‘ is incorrectly converted to the literal
string ‘”b’GET”’‘.
To verify that this change resolves the issue, we should create a script that replicates the problem as
described. We’ll write a script that uses the ‘requests‘ library to make a request with a binary method
and check if it now handles the method correctly.
Let’s create a new file called ‘reproduce_issue.py‘ to test the fix.

Now that we have created the ‘reproduce_issue.py‘ file, let’s write a script that attempts to send a request
with a binary method string, which should now be handled correctly due to our fix in ‘sessions.py‘.
We’ll write a simple script that imports the ‘requests‘ library, sets a binary method, and tries to make a
request to a test URL.

The script has been written and should now attempt to send a request using a binary method string. This
will help us verify if the issue has been resolved by the changes we made to ‘sessions.py‘.

The script ran successfully and received a 200 OK response, which indicates that the issue with handling
binary method strings has been resolved. The ‘requests‘ library is now correctly processing the binary
string ‘b’GET’‘ as a valid HTTP method.
Since the fix appears to be working, we can clean up by removing the ‘reproduce_issue.py‘ script, as it
is no longer needed. After that, we can submit our changes to the code base.

Analysis for pylint-dev/pylint-5859

Issue Summary. The issue involves the -notes option in pylint, which fails to report fixme
warnings (W0511) for note tags that are entirely punctuation. Specifically, when running pylint
with the -notes="YES,???" option, only the “YES” tag is recognized, and the “???” tag is
ignored. The expected behavior is to recognize the punctuation-only tag normally.
Interaction Summary
      1. Reproducing the Issue:
           • The agent started by creating a test.py file and added comments to replicate the
              issue described. This was followed by running pylint to confirm the issue, which
              only reported the “YES” note and not the “???” note.
      2. Searching for Relevant Code:
           • The agent attempted to search for the handling of the -notes option using the
              search_dir command. After some initial confusion with the command options,
              it successfully identified the pylint/checkers/misc.py file as containing the
              relevant code.
      3. Editing the Code:
           • The agent located the regular expression responsible for matching note tags within the
              open method of the EncodingChecker class. It modified the regular expression to
              handle punctuation-only note tags by replacing the word boundary \b with a lookahead
              assertion (?¯\W|$).
      4. Test Changes with Reproduction Code:
           • After making the modification, the agent re-ran pylint on the test.py file. The
              output confirmed that both note tags (“YES” and “???”) were now correctly identified.
           • Clean Up and Submit:
           • Finally, the agent removed the test.py file and submitted the changes.
Evaluation The agent effectively replicated the issue, identified and navigated to the relevant code,
made a targeted modification to the regular expression, and verified the fix through testing. While
the agent’s solution successfully passes the necessary tests, there are slight differences in behavior
between the agent’s solution and the gold patch. In particular, the agent replaced the \b word
boundary in the regular expression to handle note tags with the regex pattern (\W|$) to mark the tag
boundary. Comparing this to the gold patch solution which uses the pattern (:|\s|\Z) in the same
way, it may be that the agent’s solution causes other unintended consequences that aren’t captured by
the existing tests.

To begin addressing the issue, we should first try to replicate the bug as described. We can do this by
creating a new Python script that includes the comments with the note tags ”YES” and ”???” and then
running pylint with the ‘–notes‘ option. Let’s start by creating a new file called ‘test.py‘ and adding the
relevant comments to it.

The ‘test.py‘ file has been updated with the example comments. Next, we should run pylint with the
‘–notes‘ option to see if we can replicate the issue where the second line with punctuation-only tags is
ignored.

pylint test.py --notes="YES,???"




Observation                                                                   pylint-dev__pylint-5859

The output confirms the issue: pylint only reports a fixme warning for the first line with the ”YES” tag
and ignores the second line with the ”???” tag. This matches the behavior described in the issue.
The next step is to locate the part of the pylint code that handles the ‘–notes‘ option and determine why
it’s ignoring note tags that are entirely punctuation. We should start by finding the file that contains the
relevant code. Since we don’t know the exact file name, we can search the directory for files that might
contain the string ‘–notes‘ to find where the option is handled.

search_dir "--notes"

It seems that the ‘search_dir‘ command did not work as expected because ‘–notes‘ was interpreted as
an option for ‘grep‘ rather than a search term. To avoid this issue, we can enclose the search term in
quotes to ensure it’s treated as a literal string. Let’s try searching again using the correct format for the
search term.

search_dir "--notes"

It appears that the issue persists because the search term is still being interpreted as an option. To
circumvent this, we can use a different search term that is less likely to be confused with a command-line
option. Let’s try searching for just ”notes” instead, which should still lead us to the relevant part of the
code.

search_dir "notes"

The search results indicate that there are several matches for ”notes” in the repository, but the most
likely candidate for the code we need to examine is in ‘pylint/checkers/misc.py‘, as it contains the most
matches. This file is probably where the miscellaneous checkers, including the fixme warning (W0511),
are implemented.
Let’s open the ‘misc.py‘ file to investigate further.

We have opened the ‘misc.py‘ file which likely contains the code for the fixme warning (W0511) related
to the ‘–notes‘ option. Since the file is 203 lines long and we are currently viewing the first 100 lines,
we need to scroll down or use the ‘goto‘ command to find the relevant section that handles the ‘–notes‘
option.
Let’s scroll down to see more of the file.

We have found the relevant section of the ‘misc.py‘ file that handles the ‘–notes‘ option. The regular
expression pattern used to match note tags is constructed in lines 122-128. It seems that the issue might
be related to how the regular expression is constructed or how it is used to match comments in the
source code.
The regular expression is built from the ‘notes‘ configuration, which is a list of comma-separated
values, and an optional ‘notes-rgx‘ regular expression. The pattern is then compiled and used in the
‘process_tokens‘ method to search for matching comments.
The issue might be that the regular expression pattern does not account for note tags that consist entirely
of punctuation characters. To fix this, we may need to adjust the regular expression pattern to ensure it
matches these tags correctly.
Before we make any changes, let’s examine the regular expression pattern construction in more detail.
We should look at the ‘open‘ method where the pattern is compiled, specifically lines 122-128.

We are now looking at the section of the ‘misc.py‘ file where the regular expression for the ‘–notes‘
option is constructed. The regular expression is built from the ‘notes‘ configuration option, which
is a list of note tags. These tags are escaped using ‘re.escape‘ and joined with a pipe ‘|‘ to form an
alternation pattern. This pattern is then used to create a regular expression that matches comments
starting with one of the note tags followed by a word boundary ‘\b‘.
The issue might be with the word boundary ‘\b‘, which does not match if the tag is followed by
punctuation. Since the tag ”???” is entirely punctuation, the word boundary may not be recognized
correctly, causing the tag not to match.
To fix this issue, we can modify the regular expression to ensure that it matches note tags that are entirely
punctuation. We can do this by removing the word boundary and allowing the tag to be followed by any
non-word character or the end of the string.
Let’s edit the regular expression construction to fix the issue.

The edit to the regular expression has been made successfully. We replaced the word boundary ‘\b‘
with a lookahead assertion ‘(?=\W|$)‘ that matches either a non-word character or the end of the string
after the note tag. This should allow the regular expression to match note tags that consist entirely of
punctuation.
Before submitting the changes, we should test to ensure that the fix works as expected. We can do this
by running pylint on the ‘test.py‘ file again with the ‘–notes‘ option to see if it now correctly identifies
the ”???” note tag.
Let’s run pylint on ‘test.py‘ with the updated code.

pylint test.py --notes="YES,???"

The pylint output now shows that it correctly identifies both the ”YES” and ”???” note tags, which

then submit our changes to the code base.
First, let’s remove the ‘test.py‘ file since it was only needed for reproducing the issue.

Analysis for sympy/sympy-21614

Issue Summary. The issue is reporting an UnedinedKind type returned when printing a
sympy.Derivative’s kind attribute. They expect something like a DerivativeKind instead
of UndefinedKind.
Interaction Summary
       1. Reproduce the Issue:              The agent began by creating a Python script
          (reproduce_issue.py) to reproduce the issue, using the reproduction code
          provided in the issue report. It ran the script and successfully reproduced the issue.
       2. Searching for Derivative Code: The agent begins to search for code where the
          Derivative class is defined. It makes several attempts with different strategies to find
          the relevant code. After a few unsuccessful approaches, looking for particular filenames, it
          searches simply for “class Derivative“, which provides a single search result. It continues to
          read the Derivative class definition, which spans many hundreds of lines.
       3. Exhausting Budget: It continuously scrolls through the function.py file where
          Derivative is defined until is exhausts its budget and terminates the episode without
          submitting.
Evaluation The agent makes a few mistakes using the search function effectively. The agent should
have made more efficient searches by using more commonsensical patterns (e.g. searching for “class
Derivative“) early on, instead of more speculative search attempts. In this particular setting, the
gold patch shows that the updated code involves overriding an inherited property kind from the
sympy.basic object. This fix would require a more thorough understanding of the codebase and
inheritence structure of Derivative to be effective. An agent attempting to resolve this issue
would need to have more targeted and efficient search approaches to improve its ability to identify
this problem.

   We’re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here’s the issue text:
   ISSUE:
   Wrong Derivative kind attribute
   I’m playing around with the ‘kind’ attribute.
   The following is correct:
   from sympy import Integral, Derivative
   from sympy import MatrixSymbol
   from sympy.abc import x
   A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)
   i = Integral(A, x)
   i.kind
   # MatrixKind(NumberKind)
   This one is wrong:
   d = Derivative(A, x)
   d.kind
   # UndefinedKind

First, I’ll create a new Python script to reproduce the issue as described. This script will attempt to
create a ‘Derivative‘ of a ‘MatrixSymbol‘ and print out the ‘kind‘ attribute to verify if it is indeed
‘UndefinedKind‘.

Now let’s paste in the example code from the issue that demonstrates the incorrect behavior for the
‘kind‘ attribute of a ‘Derivative‘ of a ‘MatrixSymbol‘.

The reproduction script has been created and updated with the code that demonstrates the issue. Now,
let’s run the script to confirm that the ‘kind‘ attribute of the ‘Derivative‘ is indeed ‘UndefinedKind‘.

The output confirms that the ‘kind‘ attribute of the ‘Derivative‘ is ‘UndefinedKind‘, which is not the
expected behavior. The next step is to locate the part of the code that handles the ‘kind‘ attribute for the
‘Derivative‘ class and make the necessary corrections.
Since the ‘Derivative‘ class is likely to be defined in a file related to calculus or differentiation, I will
search for the file that contains the ‘Derivative‘ class definition.

find_file "derivative.py"

 It seems that the file name I searched for does not match the actual file name where the ‘Derivative‘ class
 is defined. The ‘Derivative‘ class might be defined in a file with a different name, possibly something
 more general related to symbolic calculus in SymPy.
 Let’s try a broader search for files that might contain the ‘Derivative‘ class definition. Since the class
 name is ‘Derivative‘, it’s likely that the file name contains ”calculus” or a similar keyword. I’ll use the
‘search_dir‘ command to look for the term ”Derivative” within the Python files in the current directory.

search_dir "Derivative" .



Observation                                                                      sympy__sympy-21614

The search for ”Derivative” returned too many results, so I need to narrow it down. Since the ‘Derivative‘
class is a core part of SymPy, it’s likely to be in a core module. A common convention is to have such

The ‘core.py‘ file in the ‘sympy/core‘ directory does not seem to contain the implementation details of
the ‘Derivative‘ class. It’s more likely that the implementation is in another file within the ‘sympy/core‘
directory. Since the ‘Derivative‘ class is a fundamental part of symbolic calculus, it might be in a file
named something like ‘function.py‘ or ‘operations.py‘.

We are now at the beginning of the ‘Derivative‘ class definition. To address the issue with the ‘kind‘
attribute, we need to find where the ‘kind‘ property is defined or handled within this class. Since the
file is large, I will scroll down to find the relevant section where the ‘kind‘ property is likely to be
implemented.

1156:    When differentiation wrt a non-Symbol is attempted, the

,→  U)
1161:         >>> assert direct == indirect
1162:
1163:    The implication of this non-symbol replacement is that all
1164:    functions are treated as independent of other functions
,→  and the
1165:    symbols are independent of the functions that contain
,→  them::
1166:
1167:         >>> x.diff(f(x))
1168:         0
1169:         >>> g(x).diff(f(x))
1170:         0
1171:
1172:    It also means that derivatives are assumed to depend only
1173:    on the variables of differentiation, not on anything
,→  contained
1174:    within the expression being differentiated::
1175:
1176:         >>> F = f(x)
1177:         >>> Fx = F.diff(x)
1178:         >>> Fx.diff(F) # derivative depends on x, not F
1179:         0
1180:         >>> Fxx = Fx.diff(x)
1181:         >>> Fxx.diff(Fx) # derivative depends on x, not Fx
1182:         0
1183:
1184:    The last example can be made explicit by showing the
,→  replacement
1185:    of Fx in Fxx with y:
1186:
1187:         >>> Fxx.subs(Fx, y)
1188:         Derivative(y, x)
1189:
1190:         Since that in itself will evaluate to zero,
,→  differentiating
1191:         wrt Fx will also be zero:
1192:
1193:         >>> _.doit()
1194:         0
1195:
1196:    Replacing undefined functions with concrete expressions
1197:
1198:    One must be careful to replace undefined functions with
,→  expressions
1199:    that contain variables consistent with the function
,→  definition and
1200:    the variables of differentiation or else insconsistent
,→  result will
1201:    be obtained. Consider the following example:
1202:
1203:    >>> eq = f(x)*g(y)
1204:    >>> eq.subs(f(x), x*y).diff(x, y).doit()
1205:    y*Derivative(g(y), y) + g(y)



                                83
1206:    >>> eq.diff(x, y).subs(f(x), x*y).doit()
1207:    y*Derivative(g(y), y)
1208:
1209:    The results differ because `f(x)` was replaced with an
,→  expression
1210:    that involved both variables of differentiation. In the
,→  abstract
1211:    case, differentiation of `f(x)` by `y` is 0; in the
,→  concrete case,
1212:    the presence of `y` made that derivative nonvanishing and

1213:    the extra `g(y)` term.

1215:    Defining differentiation for an object

Analysis for django/django-14411

Issue Summary. The issue involves the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget in the Django admin
interface. The label element for this widget has a ’for’ attribute that points to a non-labelable element.
Since the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget renders text rather than an input element, the label
should not have a ’for’ attribute.
Interaction Summary

        1. Locate the Relevant File:               The agent began by searching for the
           ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget definition using the find_file command,
           but found no results. It then used the search_dir command to find references to the
           widget within the repository and located relevant matches in several files. The agent chose
           to first examine the helpers.py file, but found it only contained a reference to the widget
           and did not include the label rendering code.
        2. Explore Related Files:    Next,  the agent opened                         the    forms.py
           file   in    the   django/contrib/auth    directory,                           which     de-
           fined    the   ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget     and                          its    associated


                                                   92
        ReadOnlyPasswordHashField. It identified that the widget used a template
        (read_only_password_hash.html) for rendering, but the template did not include
        relevant information relating to the Widget’s for attribute.
     3. Edit the Class Definition: Returning to forms.py, the agent found the
        UserChangeForm which used the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField. It reasoned
        that Django’s form rendering system likely added the ’for’ attribute automatically.
        To address the issue, the agent attempted to write a label_tag method for the
        ReadOnlyPasswordHashField to exclude the ’for’ attribute. The agent made several
        edits to this effect, importing the necessary utilities from django.utils.html and
        adding a custom label_tag method.
     4. Submit Without Testing: After the desired changes were made, the agent proceeds to
        submit without testing as it assumes that a Django server cannot be run and tested in this
        environment.

Evaluation The agent correctly identified the need to customize the label rendering for the
ReadOnlyPasswordHashField class. However, its solution failed to solve the issue since
it did not understand how labels were defined for a Widget object. In actuality, the model needed
to override the id_for_label property defined in the Widget class to change this behavior
properly. Similar functionality can be seen in other parts of the codebase.

   Issue                                                                       django__django-14411

   We’re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here’s the issue text:
   ISSUE:
   Label for ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget points to non-labelable element.
   Description
   (last modified by David Sanders)
   In the admin, the label element for the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget widget has a ’for’ attribute
   which points to a non-labelable element, since the widget just renders text, not an input. There’s no
   labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn’t have a ’for’ attribute.

   To address the issue, we need to locate the file that contains the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘
   widget’s rendering code. Since this is likely part of the Django admin, we should start by searching for
   the file that defines ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘. Let’s use the ‘find_file‘ command to locate this
   file within the repository.

   find_file "ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget"

It seems that the ‘find_file‘ command did not yield any results for ”ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget”.
This could be because the file name does not exactly match the widget name. Since the widget is likely
to be part of the Django admin, it might be located in a file related to forms or widgets in the admin app.
Let’s try a broader search using the ‘search_dir‘ command to look for the term ”ReadOnlyPassword-
HashWidget” within the files of the repository. This should help us find the file where the widget is
defined or used.

The search results indicate that there are matches for ”ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget” in several files,
but the most likely places where the rendering code would be defined are in ‘helpers.py‘ and ‘forms.py‘
within the ‘django/contrib/admin‘ and ‘django/contrib/auth‘ directories, respectively.
Since the issue is related to the admin interface, let’s first check the ‘helpers.py‘ file in the ‘django/con-
trib/admin‘ directory. We’ll open this file and look for the relevant code.

The ‘helpers.py‘ file is now open, but we need to find the specific part of the code that deals with the
‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘. Since the file is quite long, we should use the ‘search_file‘ command
 to locate the term within this file.

We have navigated to the relevant section of the ‘helpers.py‘ file where the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHash-
Widget‘ is mentioned. The comment on line 215 suggests that there is a special case handling for the
‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘. The code on line 216 checks if the widget has a ‘read_only‘ attribute
 and, if so, renders the widget directly.
To address the issue, we need to ensure that the label for the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ does not
 have a ’for’ attribute, as it points to a non-labelable element. We should look for the part of the code
where the label is being rendered with the ’for’ attribute and make the necessary changes.
 Since the code snippet we are looking at does not show the rendering of the label, we need to find where
 the label is being rendered. It might be in the template files or somewhere else in the code. Let’s search
 for the term ”label” in the current file to find where labels are being rendered.

The search results show several instances where labels are being handled in the ‘helpers.py‘ file. The
most promising lines for our issue seem to be around line 191, where a label tag is being formatted with
a ‘for‘ attribute. Let’s navigate to that line to examine the context and see if this is where we need to
make our changes.

We are now looking at the section of the ‘helpers.py‘ file where a label tag is being generated. However,
this label tag does not include a ’for’ attribute, which means this is not the part of the code responsible
for the issue described.
The issue states that the label for the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ has a ’for’ attribute pointing to
a non-labelable element. Since the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ is likely a custom widget used
in the Django admin, the rendering of its label might be handled in a template or in the widget’s own
Python code.
Given that the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ is part of the ‘django.contrib.auth‘ app, we should look
into the ‘forms.py‘ file in the ‘django/contrib/auth‘ directory, as it might contain the definition of the
widget and the rendering of its label.
Let’s open the ‘forms.py‘ file in the ‘django/contrib/auth‘ directory to investigate further.

We have opened the ‘forms.py‘ file in the ‘django/contrib/auth‘ directory and found the definition
of the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ starting at line 33. The widget uses a template named
‘read_only_password_hash.html‘ for rendering, as specified on line 34.
Since the issue is related to the label’s ’for’ attribute in the rendered HTML, we should look at the
template file ‘read_only_password_hash.html‘ to see how the label is being rendered. Let’s use the
‘find_file‘ command to locate this template file within the repository.

The template file ‘read_only_password_hash.html‘ does not show a ‘label‘ element with a ’for’ attribute,
which means the issue might be elsewhere. The issue description mentions that the label element for
the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ has a ’for’ attribute pointing to a non-labelable element. Since we
don’t see a ‘label‘ element here, the ’for’ attribute is likely added in the Python code that generates the
HTML for the widget or in a different part of the template.



                                                   105
Given that the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ is a custom widget, the rendering of the label with the
’for’ attribute might be handled in the Python code where the widget is used in a form, rather than in the
widget’s template itself.
Let’s go back to the ‘forms.py‘ file and look for the usage of ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ in a
form where a label might be rendered with a ’for’ attribute. We should look for a form that includes
‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ and inspect how the label is being generated.

We are back in the ‘forms.py‘ file where the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ is defined. Since the
issue is with the label’s ’for’ attribute, we need to find where the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ is used
in a form and how the label is being rendered there.
The ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ is a custom field that uses the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘,
and it’s likely used in the admin forms for the User model. We should search for the usage of
‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ within this file to find where it’s included in a form.
Let’s use the ‘search_file‘ command to search for ”ReadOnlyPasswordHashField” in the current file.

We are now looking at the ‘UserChangeForm‘ class where the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ is used.
The field is instantiated with a label on line 136, and the help text includes an HTML anchor tag for
changing the password.
The issue reported is that the label element for the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget‘ has a ’for’ attribute
which points to a non-labelable element. However, in the ‘UserChangeForm‘, the label is defined in
the Python code and not in the HTML template. This suggests that the ’for’ attribute is likely added
automatically by Django’s form rendering.
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that when the form is rendered, the label for the ‘ReadOnly-
PasswordHashField‘ does not include a ’for’ attribute. Since the rendering of form fields to HTML is
handled by Django’s form rendering system, we may need to customize the rendering for this specific
field to exclude the ’for’ attribute.
One way to do this is to override the ‘label_tag‘ method for the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ to
ensure it does not render a ’for’ attribute. Let’s edit the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ class to include
this customization.
We will add a custom ‘label_tag‘ method to the ‘ReadOnlyPasswordHashField‘ class that returns a
label without the ’for’ attribute.

E     Statements
E.1   Ethics & Broader Impacts

Prior works have established how the growing usage of LMs that can code also carries a certain
amount of risk. We identify three main risks that could arise when building and using a system like
SWE-agent, then discuss how we incorporates measures that mitigate such problems.
First is the security risks that come with executing LM-generated code on device. When evaluating
on software engineering tasks that feature an incredibly diverse number of issue descriptions, run-
ning code generations on a personal computing device can have negative side effects, such as the
unintentional removal of digital assets (e.g., rm -rf asset/). To defend against this, we design
SWE-agent to use ephemeral containers for both inference and evaluation. SWE-agent’s execution
environment and the SWE-bench evaluation framework are both carried out in sand-boxed code
environments, which is made possible with Docker. Executing code in a Docker container ensures
that its effects are mostly isolated from the rest of the system. While not considered as secure as
virtualized hardware isolation, the namespace isolation provided by Docker containers is deemed
sufficient for code that is not deliberately engineered to exploit recent container escape vulnerabilities.
More details are discussion is in §A.2.
Second, if the wider community develops interest for SWE-agent and builds upon it, it is also
possible that illegitimate evaluation datasets or infrastructure can be used to inject testing devices
with malicious code or instructions to generate malicious code. For instance, an unofficial repository
claiming to host an inference/evaluation harness for SWE-agent/bench could include a task instance
with an issue description that tells the LM agent to build key logging functionality and store it in
a hidden folder. To eliminate confusion and reduce the possibility of such an event, we provide
clear guidelines listed on our GitHub repositories, data stores, and websites indicating the official
repositories and channels that we actively maintain. We also encourage third parties to incorporate
any improvements into our codebase and help with integrating such contributions.
Lastly are the consequences of software engineering agents being deployed in the real world. Prior
works have conceptualized and put forth prototypes of agents that can carry out offensive security
measures. It is also not difficult to imagine that a system like SWE-agent can be incorporated
into pipelines resulting in the production of malicious code. SWE-agent’s strong performance on
SWE-bench implies that future AI systems will likely be increasingly adept in the aforementioned use
cases. Releasing SWE-agent as an open source tool can support research towards designing sound,
effective constraints for what software engineering agents are permitted to do. It can also serve as a
system that legal experts and policy-making entities can experiment with to shape the future of what
AI-driven end to end software engineering could look like.

E.2   Reproducibility

To help the greater community reproduce the results presented in this paper and build on the SWE-
agent platform, we open source all of our resources that were created for this project. The source
code for the interactive pipeline, context management logic, command implementations, interface
design, and everything else is entirely available in a GitHub repository. We provide extensive text and
video documentation describing how to run and modify different parts of the codebase. Practitioners
should be able to easily recover our findings by running the agent with simple scripts. We also open
source all inference and evaluation artifacts (e.g., trajectories, code generations, evaluation execution
traces, analysis notebooks). The results presented in the main and supplementary parts of this paper
can be fully rendered from the data. Finally, we also maintain an active online help forum to assist
with any reproduction problems or questions about how to build on ACI design and SWE-agent.

E.3   Limitations & Future Work

The final SWE-agent configuration has a small toolkit, albeit highly effective. With SWE-agent’s
highly extensible design, we’re excited by the prospect of adding more tools, such as web browsing or
static analysis, that can leverage more signals from an issue description and codebase to improve the
% Resolved performance. Many tools trialed by prior works from software engineering and language
model agents, such as static/dynamic analysis, spectrum based fault localization, or test generation
via fuzzing could prove useful.


                                                   117
Second, in this work, the ACI development process and case studies are done manually. Many
components of SWE-agent were crafted from observations of recurring behavior within a single
trajectory or across multiple trajectories. Automating part or all of this process could not only
accelerate work built on top of SWE-agent, but also provide greater insights into developing ACI
principles for agentic software engineering. Contemporary works have explored automated prompting
to improve performance on traditional sequence to sequence tasks, supplanting the need for manual
prompt design. Thinking about automating ACI design raises immediately interesting questions
around how such systems can scrutinize and iterate upon their own designs. Ensuring such horizon
leads to incremental performance improvements across a longer horizon is also a challenging question.
Finally, the scope of SWE-agent is exclusively focused on programmatic tasks like software en-
gineering and code generation. We’re curious to see whether the same principles of ACI and our
observations of agent behavior are transferable to different domains. Recent work around applying
LM agents to a variety of digital work applications have proliferated, such as use cases in education
technology, data analysis, and enterprise workflows. We hope that thinking about improving perfor-
mance of agentic workflows on these domains through the lens of ACI design can be a symbiotic
process. For instance, for a task such a shopping on the web, in place of a typical Google-style search
tool, could agents benefit from additional information beyond a list of each page’s title and snippet?
Would the design vary if the nature of the downstream task were to change slightly? For a completely
different task, such as navigating an internal company knowledge base to help a recently on-boarded
employee, how might the search interface be best adjusted to the agent?
Similar to the progression of the field of User Experience (UX) and Human Computer Interaction
(HCI) research, applying ACI to other domains could not only yield improvements in downstream
task performance, but also further expand the list of ACI principles. We believe that the fundamental
motivations for ACI, the foundational principles we put forth, and our case study of SWE-agent as an
instantiation of implementing and improving an ACI can motivate such work.

# Locked Task Prompt

# SWE-T1 Locked SWE-agent Task Prompt

Task type: issue-to-patch

You have a local repository snapshot in the starter workspace. The issue or
failing-test context is:

TSQL - L031 incorrectly triggers "Avoid using aliases in join condition" when no join present
## Expected Behaviour



Both of these queries should pass, the only difference is the addition of a table alias 'a':



1/ no alias



```

SELECT [hello]

FROM

    mytable

```



2/ same query with alias



```

SELECT a.[hello]

FROM

    mytable AS a

```



## Observed Behaviour



1/ passes

2/ fails with: L031: Avoid using aliases in join condition.



But there is no join condition :-)



## Steps to Reproduce



Lint queries above



## Dialect



TSQL



## Version



sqlfluff 0.6.9

Python 3.6.9



## Configuration



N/A

Verification command:

```powershell
D:\a_work\gitee\venvs\sqlfluff__sqlfluff-1625\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest test/cli/commands_test.py::test__cli__command_directed -q
```

Return a single unified diff patch. The patch must apply cleanly from the
workspace root. Keep the change minimal, inspect files before editing, and do
not claim success unless the verification command passes.

# Output Contract

Return exactly one unified diff patch. The patch must apply from the starter workspace root and should be minimal.
