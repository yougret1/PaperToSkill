TSQL - L031 incorrectly triggers "Avoid using aliases in join condition" when no join present
## Expected Behaviour

Both of these queries should pass, the only difference is the addition of a table alias 'a':

1/ no alias

```
SELECT [hello]
FROM
    mytable
```

2/ same query with alias

```
SELECT a.[hello]
FROM
    mytable AS a
```

## Observed Behaviour

1/ passes
2/ fails with: L031: Avoid using aliases in join condition.

But there is no join condition :-)

## Steps to Reproduce

Lint queries above

## Dialect

## Version
