# PaperToSkill Short-Term Memory

Read this file after any context compaction or session resume. Also read
`memory/long_term_memory.md` before taking project actions.

Current date: 2026-07-04.

## Current Task

- Latest user request: save the current phase, upload to GitHub if possible,
  then continue the project. If GitHub/network/download blocks progress, write
  the concrete command, error, and blocked artifact to
  `C:\Users\19351\Desktop\tem\toHuman.md`, then continue non-blocked local
  work.
- Current execution priority remains the core real-reuse main experiment.
  SWE-T1 source-context reporting, SNAP artifact-execution diagnosis, and the
  phase108 SNAP executable-artifact follow-up are complete and remain
  diagnostic only.
- Latest confirmed GitHub backup includes commit `9f2e52f` (`Aggregate
  real-reuse LLM ablation pilot`). `git push origin main` succeeded and
  `git ls-remote --heads origin main` returned the same commit, so the earlier
  push blocker for `10ffc10`, `516895a`, and `6c5c360` is resolved.
- Phase109 REF-T2 GPT-family real-reuse LLM ablation pilot, the LLM-ablation
  aggregation helper/results, and record-sync edits are locally committed and
  remote-backed through `9f2e52f`. Verification before phase save passed:
  181 unit tests, `check_real_reuse_benchmark.py --strict`,
  `check_paper_tables.py --strict`, `check_paper_claims.py --strict`,
  `check_submission_review.py --strict`, `check_aaai_package.py --strict`,
  `check_goal_completion.py --strict`,
  `check_reproducibility_package.py --strict`, `git diff --check` with only
  CRLF warnings, and a raw-key scan with no matches.
- `C:\Users\19351\Desktop\tem\toHuman.md` should say no immediate human action
  is required, and `ok.txt` should only be created for completed human-fidelity
  annotation or a concrete placed core asset.

## Latest Record Sync Policy

- Keep the main experiment as eight locked paper-task rows comparing Summary
  with PaperToSkill under source-paper-style objective metrics.
- Do not add a separate domain-robustness experiment; current breadth is the
  eight main paper-tasks.
- Keep component ablation appendix-only and user study last/optional.
- Treat Full Excerpt as an auxiliary sanity check, not a main baseline.
- Attach LLM ablation to the real-reuse task protocol; do not use older
  saved-response usage-plan scoring as downstream task-success evidence.
- Provider latency, API timeout, and retry counts are availability metadata,
  not core effectiveness metrics. Give third-party LLM calls longer timeout and
  more retries.
- Preserve `results/real_reuse/main_run_selection.json` so follow-up rows such
  as SWE-T1 phase107 do not silently replace paper-facing main-table cells.

## Current Core Experiment State

- Main experiment: `Real-Reuse Main Results`, comparing `Summary` vs
  `PaperToSkill` under the same locked paper-task, input/output, scorer, and
  local run setting.
- This is not a real-user study. The main metrics are source-paper-style
  objective task metrics, not user-experience metrics.
- Provider latency, API timeout, retry count, and third-party service
  instability are not core effectiveness metrics. Give model calls more timeout
  and retry budget, and record provider availability separately.
- Current first GPT-family `gpt-5.5` pass has scored all eight rows:
  AIDE-T1 `0.816/0.817` solved by both; AIDE-T2 `0.000/0.826`
  PaperToSkill-only success; SWE-T1 `0.000/0.000` patch-apply failure;
  SWE-T2 `0.000/1.000` PaperToSkill-only success; REF-T1/T2 `1.000/1.000`;
  SNAP-T1/T2 `0.000/0.500` and `0.200/0.400` below success threshold.
- Evidence boundary: this is mixed first-pass downstream stress-test and
  failure-boundary evidence, not aggregate PaperToSkill superiority over
  Summary.
- SWE-T1 phase107 shared-source-context follow-up is complete locally with
  Summary/PaperToSkill both `0.000/0.000`. Unlike the first-pass row, both
  candidate patches applied; the failure reason is `test_command_failed`
  because the hidden test expected the specific L031 warning-message change
  while both candidates edited rule logic. This is diagnostic follow-up
  evidence, not a main-table replacement.
- SNAP artifact-execution diagnosis is complete in
  `results/real_reuse/snapatac2_artifact_followup.{md,json}`. It found that
  selected SNAP rows are plan/JSON outputs under a non-executing runner, while
  the scorer requires completed artifacts plus runtime/memory records. Fixtures
  are readable; `snapatac2` is not importable in the current Python
  environment. Main SNAP rows remain unchanged.
- Phase108 SNAP executable-artifact follow-up is complete in
  `results/real_reuse/snapatac2_executable_artifact_followup.{csv,md,json}`
  with runner `scripts/run_real_reuse_snapatac2_executable_followup.py`.
  It executes a pre-registered controlled scaffold over the same miniature
  fixtures; all four SNAP-T1/T2 Summary/PaperToSkill rows score 1.000 under
  the existing scorer. It does not append to `raw_rows.jsonl`, does not replace
  main SNAP rows, and does not show PaperToSkill advantage.

## Current Auxiliary Evidence Policy

- Full Excerpt sanity is scored for AIDE-T1, SWE-T1, and SNAP-T1, but it is
  auxiliary sanity/cost/context evidence only, not a main baseline.
- LLM ablation should be attached to the real-reuse task protocol and should
  not rely on the older saved-response usage-plan protocol as downstream task
  evidence.
- A pre-registered real-reuse LLM ablation command plan now exists in
  `benchmarks/real_reuse/llm_ablation_v0.json` and
  `results/real_reuse/llm_ablation_plan.{md,json}`. It selects AIDE-T2,
  SWE-T2, and REF-T2; uses GPT-family `gpt-5.5`, Claude-family
  `claude-opus-4-8`, and DeepSeek-family `deepseek-v4-flash`; and gives each
  provider call 300 seconds, 5 attempts, and 5-second retry delays. Phase109
  has collected the REF-T2 / GPT-family / `gpt-5.5` Summary/PaperToSkill pair:
  both rows score 1.000, both succeeded on attempt 1, and
  `results/real_reuse/llm_ablation_summary.md` reports 2 collected rows out of
  18 expected rows. This is ceiling/control auxiliary evidence, not a main-row
  replacement and not PaperToSkill advantage.
- Human-fidelity annotation supports semantic fidelity and reviewability, not
  main task effectiveness. It remains pending: 0 scored rows and 24 pending
  paper-by-criterion cells.
- Quality/grounding gates remain supporting evidence: rubric, source-span,
  source-map, context coverage, usage examples, token accounting, paper-table
  gates, and claim gates.
- Do not keep a separate domain breadth/coverage auxiliary experiment; the
  selected main paper-tasks provide the current breadth.

## Model And External Evidence State

- GPT protocol refresh completed both current rows with `gpt-5.5`.
- DeepSeek completed both current rows with `deepseek-v4-flash`; the DeepSeek
  handoff reports `responses_present`.
- Latest Claude protocol refresh used Anthropic Messages but was blocked by
  provider HTTP 502, so scored Claude rows come from previously saved response
  files. Treat the 502 as provider availability, not model quality.
- Local token accounting is complete for the current evidence set and replaces
  provider billing/success-per-dollar claims in the current paper scope.
- AI-Scientist-v2 dry-run succeeded historically. The bounded
  AI-Scientist-v2 LLM-client smoke is now complete, and the bounded full
  live-run handoff is complete with one completion directory. This is bounded
  integration/synthetic sensitivity evidence, not human fidelity, real-data
  validation, or broad live research-task success.
- AAAI decision is recorded as `wait_for_external_evidence`; final submission
  readiness remains pending under that policy.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Continue the pre-registered real-reuse LLM ablation rows when provider env
   vars are available, or use the local API docs under
   `C:\Users\19351\Desktop\论文\SelfPaper\LLMAPIDocument` to set them in the
   shell only. Do not commit raw keys.
   Current collected slice is only REF-T2 / GPT-family / `gpt-5.5`; AIDE-T2,
   SWE-T2, Claude, and DeepSeek rows remain pending.
2. Keep Summary and PaperToSkill paired under the same task/scorer contract for
   any follow-up. Main SNAP rows remain unchanged unless explicitly promoted.
3. During core reruns, collect auxiliary raw data where cheap: provider
   availability, failure reasons, context/token proxies, and raw rows needed
   for real-reuse LLM ablation.
4. Run broader verification gates before the next phase save:
   `check_real_reuse_benchmark.py`, `check_paper_tables.py`,
   `check_reproducibility_package.py`, `check_goal_completion.py`,
   `check_paper_claims.py`, `git diff --check`, and a raw-key scan.
5. Save and push the next meaningful phase after new core-experiment progress.

## Boundaries

Do not claim:

- Aggregate downstream effectiveness or broad superiority over Summary.
- Human-validated semantic fidelity.
- Provider billing, live invoices, or success-per-dollar evidence.
- Saved-response scoring as proof of live downstream task success.
- Reliable arbitrary-PDF-to-skill automation.
- Final AAAI submission readiness.
